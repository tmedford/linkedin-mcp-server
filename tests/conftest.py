    that server *and* the ambient credentials and refuses the pair. That failure
    says nothing about the code, reproduces on no other machine, and is
    invisible in CI, which is the worst combination a test can have.

    Two sources rather than a list kept here, because a hand-written list is the
    same bug one setting along: it has to be remembered whenever a setting is
    added, and forgetting it produces a test that passes or fails only on the
    machine that happens to define it.

    * every key the loader reads, from the loader's own table;
    * every variable this project names after itself. Those are read directly
      through ``os.environ`` all over the package — debug switches, the trace
      mode, the container hint, the update check — and none of them go through
      the table above. Measured: with ``LINKEDIN_DEBUG_BRIDGE_COOKIE_SET`` set,
      a cookie-import test fails, and a run with every one of them set failed 22
      tests.

    ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST``, which pytest owns, ``PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH``,
    which points at an installed browser, and the platform's own

    reads as unrelated: ``uvicorn`` asks ``sys.stdout.isatty()`` while building
    its log config, so a closed stream surfaces as ``Unable to configure
    formatter 'default'`` in a daemon test.

    Under pytest's own capturing every test gets a fresh ``sys.stdout``, which

    ``monkeypatch`` then records as the one to restore, tears down first, and
    closes it, so the undo reinstalls a closed stream.
