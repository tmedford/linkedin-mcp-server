"""Getting one owner started, and never two.

The properties here are about process lifetime, file descriptor inheritance and
the kernel's arbitration, so most of these spawn real processes. A test that
stayed inside one interpreter could show the code takes the branches it means to
and would not show the thing that matters: that exactly one browser-owning
process exists, and that the lock dies with it.

Four of these pin defects that were live in this code and found by running it:
a failed child read as "somebody is starting" and cost a full deadline, a child
that reported failure kept the inherited lock, a crashed owner's descriptor was
handed back as attachable, and the parent's copy of the lock outliving the owner
would have wedged every recovery.

            # These three are asserted together because the argument that the

            # confirmed dead *before* the handshake pipe is released, so the

            # cross-thread close, and the writer holds only the stdin stream —
            # never a lock descriptor — so a broken pipe is enough to end it.
            #
            # That argument is reasoned rather than measured on Windows, and
            # nothing checks it. The platform-behaviour job names five files and
            # this is not one of them, and the skip above says why it could not
            # be added as it stands: `_start_owner` takes the contending branch
            # there and answers CONTENDED where this expects FAILED. Asserted
            # anyway, because the argument is what the cleanup order rests on
            # and it should at least be written down where the order is.
            #
            # What it does not do is prove the *ordering*. Moving the release
            # ahead of the stop leaves this green on POSIX, because `detach()`
            # never blocks here whatever the child is doing. On Windows the same
            # change is the difference between an end of file and a wait on a
            # live reader — and nothing observes that distinction, here or in
            # CI. The paragraph above says why.
            #
            # Joined first, because nothing in production closes that
            # descriptor: the writer's own `with stream:` does, as it unwinds
            # from the broken pipe, so asserting the instant `_start_owner`
            # returns races that unwinding by construction. It has lost that
            # race twice on CI, both times on these two assertions and both
            # times green on a rerun. The rate is a property of the machine
            # rather than of the code: on a saturated laptop it failed 4 runs in
            # 10, and elsewhere it would not reproduce at all.
            #
            # So the property meant here is that the writer ends *promptly* once
            # the child is gone, which is what the join states and the instant
            # read only approximated. One second, and it masks nothing: both the
            # exit status and `elapsed` are already fixed by the time it runs.
            #
            # It buys nothing beyond that. A writer blocked on a full pipe
            # survives the handshake release and ends only when the child dies,
            # in either order, so the ordering above stays a Windows claim.

    Windows keeps daemon state under ``.mcp-server-linkedin-v2``, and every

    releases from ever creating that directory again is a *file* published at the
    same name, and ``prepare_daemon_state`` publishes it inside the inspector's
    reader thread.

    The frontend's one second read budget expiring does not stop that thread. It
    only stops the frontend from hearing about it, and the election went straight
    on to spawn. Under a package rolled back on disk that child is a predecessor,
    which creates the legacy directory for itself: v2 refuses to run beside it
    from then on, and the frontends that could report it are exactly the ones
    that no longer run.

    The child here is that predecessor, taking the name if it is free, and the
    inspection is blocked where the real one blocks.

        The required Windows CI job runs this whole class natively, where
        ``os.name`` is "nt" with nothing patched, so ``_spawn`` creates a Job
        and hands it the gate. A real one cannot serve these cases: ``_Child``
        is not a process and exposes no ``_handle``, so ``assign_popen``
        raises before a single startup assertion runs. Nor may one be created
        here, because a real Job would contain this interpreter's own
        descendants and terminate them.

        So the contract is modelled instead, in the order ``_spawn`` and
        ``_stop_child`` perform it: created by name, assigned the gate before
        the gate is released, terminated or closed once, its process handle
        released after the gate exits, and proved empty before it is done.
        Every step is checked, so a production reordering fails here rather
        than passing quietly.

        Termination kills the assigned child, which is what
        ``TerminateJobObject`` does to every member of the Job. That keeps the
        ``child.killed`` assertions meaning the same thing on both platforms:
        on POSIX the kill arrives through the ``terminate_process_group``
        stand-in, and on Windows through the containment that replaces it.

        genuinely times out rather than being told to.

        Deterministic rather than timed. The owner is stopped *before* the second
        frontend starts and released on a timer, so the frontend cannot miss the
        window: every probe it makes until the resume lands in a stalled process.
