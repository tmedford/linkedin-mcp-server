"""The shared launch-options builder: which browser, and whose choice.

Both launch paths go through `build_launch_options`, and the reason this file
exists is that the interesting failure is silent. Without a channel, Playwright
picks the *binary* from the `headless` flag alone, so `--login` (which forces
headed) minted every session in the full browser while page reading used the
stripped headless shell. Nothing errors; the two browsers simply differ in
plugins, `window.chrome` and notification permissions.
