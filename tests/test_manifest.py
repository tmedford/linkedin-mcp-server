"""Rules about ``manifest.json`` that only a reader of the host can know.

``mcpb validate`` in the release workflow checks the manifest against its
schema. A manifest can pass that and still produce a bundle that cannot start,
because the schema says nothing about how a host resolves ``${user_config.X}``.

Measured against Claude Desktop's own substitution routine. It builds one
replacement map from the manifest's ``default`` values, overlays the answers
the user gave, and then rewrites ``${...}`` occurrences for the keys in that
map. A key in neither source is not in the map, and the placeholder is passed
to the process verbatim.

So an optional field with no ``default`` hands the server the string
``${user_config.proxy_server}`` as if it were an address. That shipped in
4.20.0 and stopped every bundle where the proxy fields were left blank, which
is the default for anyone not using a proxy. The rules below are that failure
written down.

Position decides what a sufficient default is, and the two positions do not
agree. Measured by replaying the routine over a manifest built for the
question:

* In a string, the value is interpolated whatever it is, so ``""`` disappears
  and leaves nothing behind. That is where the four proxy variables sit.
* As an entire element of ``args``, the substitution is guarded by a
  truthiness test on the replacement. ``""`` is falsy, so the element keeps its
  literal and the browser is started with ``${user_config.NAME}`` as an
  argument.
* An array-valued default reached from a string is refused outright: the
  routine logs "Cannot replace with array value" and leaves the literal.

A rule that only knew the first case would bless the other two.
