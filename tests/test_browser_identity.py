"""The browser must not contradict itself, checked rather than remembered.

Everything the identity work rests on was established by hand: a user agent
read off one surface, client hints off another, a frame rate counted against a
control window. None of it is repeatable, and a dependency bump can undo any of
it without a single test going red. That has already happened twice in one
week: the lock moved 148 to 149, and both times the only reason anyone knew the
identity still held was that someone went and measured it again.

**Relations, not values.** Every assertion here compares two things the browser
says about itself. Nothing pins a version, a brand string or a screen size,
because all of those move on their own and a test that pins them is a test
somebody will delete after the third false alarm. What cannot move is that the
page and its workers agree, that the advertised brand major matches the user
agent, and that the window fits the screen it claims to stand on.

**It fails rather than skips where it is meant to gate.** The existing
browser-DOM tests skip when no browser is installed, which is right for them:
they check extraction JS, and running them locally is a convenience. This one
is a gate. A gate that skips itself when the thing it guards is missing is not
a gate, so in CI a missing browser or display is a failure. Locally it still
skips, with a reason that says what to install.

**Two launch modes, because one of them is inert on Linux.**
``hidden_target_is_supported()`` is macOS-only, so the product default
(``headless=True``) is the windowless hidden target on macOS and Chromium's
real headless mode on Linux, where it does announce itself. Asserting "no
headless token" against the default would therefore be an assertion that
catches nothing on the platform CI runs. The headed mode is the one the
container image is heading for, and it is where that assertion bites.

Only three cases are about a particular mode: the headless token, whether the
hidden target was used, and whether the default mode matches its own claim.
Everything else is true of a browser however it was started, so it runs against
both, which costs nothing because both launches are already cached. A
regression that appears in headed Chromium alone is otherwise invisible here,
and headed is not the cheaper mode to leave uncovered.

**Each launch leaves evidence of its first navigation.** The page's first
``goto`` has run out Patchright's 30s on a Windows runner against this plain
loopback origin, and the cached failure then fails every case of that mode
with one message. ``differential.first_navigation`` observes each launch from
before it starts, without asking the browser anything, and the module
publishes what it saw whatever the cases did: one record per launch, however
many cases replay it.

#: is ``all`` in place of ``any``. Without a way to name the fake entry, the
#: strongest available rule is "at least one brand agrees with the user agent",
#: and that passes a list carrying ``Chromium`` at 149 beside ``Google Chrome``
#: at 150 -- a browser contradicting itself in public, which is precisely what
#: is being looked for. Identifying it structurally instead would have to
#: assume how many fake entries there are, and the specification does not fix
#: that either. So: a rename costs one red that names the brands it saw and is

        A native ``Navigator.prototype.webdriver`` is an accessor with a getter,
        no setter, and configurable. Redefining it to return ``false`` is the
        usual way to hide automation, and the descriptor does not give that
        away: ``Object.defineProperty`` on an existing configurable property
        leaves every attribute the caller did not name exactly as it was, so
        the shape still matches. Measured, against exactly that mutation.

        The getter's source does give it away, but only if the whole of it is
        read. Looking for ``[native code]`` as a substring is not enough:
        ``function webdriver() { /* [native code] */ return false; }`` contains
        it and passes, measured in Chrome 151. What a native accessor produces
        is the NativeFunction form ECMA-262 specifies, and nothing written in
        JavaScript can be spelled that way.

        Held against ``userAgent`` rather than a literal, because that is a
        native accessor on the same prototype that nothing has a reason to
        touch. If V8 changes how it stringifies built-ins, both change together
        and this survives; pinning the spelling is what would not.

        The control is checked as well, or two accessors patched together would
        agree with each other and say nothing. Against the NativeFunction
        grammar from ECMA-262 rather than against today's exact spelling, so it
        holds whatever whitespace an engine chooses while still refusing
        anything with a function body in it.

        And the prototype is not the only place to look. Defining ``webdriver``
        directly on ``navigator`` shadows the accessor without touching it, so
        the value reads false while every attribute here still measures native.
        Measured in the bundled browser: a real browser has no own property.

        **Where this stops, stated rather than papered over.** Everything above
        is read from inside the page's realm, so a patch applied to that whole
        realm can answer every question consistently: replace the getter, patch
        ``Function.prototype.toString`` to describe both it and itself as
        native, delegate for everything else, and each assertion here is
        satisfied. Measured, and one more layer of self-description does not
        close it, because the layer is asked the same way. Two escapes were
        tried and neither works: the isolated world ``page.evaluate`` uses
        shares these prototypes, so it reads the patch back unchanged; and a
        CDP read still has to evaluate ``getOwnPropertyDescriptor`` in the
        realm, which is as patchable as the rest.

        That boundary is the realm's, not this file's. The standard here is
        that nothing the browser says is refuted by another surface of the same
        browser, and a uniformly patched realm is coherent -- dishonest, but
        coherent, and invisible to the websites this exists to reason about.
        Proving the runtime unmodified is a different exercise from proving it
        consistent, and it wants a different tool.
