"""O2: the signals a row's traced actors send, what they named, and the canaries.

**The oracle is strace, on Linux only, and it sees only what it traces.**
``strace -f -ttt -yy -e trace=<TRACED_SYSCALLS>,<FOLLOWED_SYSCALLS> -p
<server|owner> -p <guardian>`` records every signal those two processes send,
and those their threads and children send, from the moment each is attached
until it ends. That is its scope and nothing else: the frontend, the driver,
the browser, a replacement owner and every moment before the attach are
outside it. So a row has two O2 readings. ``traced`` is the oracle's, for that
scope only. ``row`` is what the row can say about every actor, which is
``violated`` on evidence (a traced violation, a dead canary) and otherwise
``unobserved``: nothing here watches the other senders, so their silence is
never promoted to ``held``.

Ubuntu's default ``kernel.yama.ptrace_scope`` is 1, which lets a tracer attach
only to its own descendants, and strace is not an ancestor of the owner, so the
oracle runs ``sudo -n strace``: only on a disposable GitHub-hosted runner,
behind the same guard as the trust step. Where the native rows opted in on
Linux the oracle is *required*: an oracle that cannot run there fails the row.
Anywhere else it is *unavailable* and says why; nothing stands in for it.

**Missing evidence is never an empty trace.** The oracle's outcome is
``complete`` only when strace attached to every pid asked for, exited on its
own with status 0 or was detached on request, left a trace file whose every
line parsed, and accounted for every tracee it covered: the roots, their
threads, and every thread or child their ``clone``, ``fork`` and ``vfork``
calls started. Each needs its own end (an exit line, or the harness's own
confirmed kill of a root), or for a thread its process's end, or the
deliberate stop's detach, which is then that tracee's boundary. A tracee strace
let go on its own, or one with no end, leaves it ``incomplete``. A tracee is a
lifetime, not a number: an end satisfies only the lifetime it follows, and a
thread id that turns up again (born anew, or writing after its end) is a
reused id the trace cannot place, so it too leaves the collection
``incomplete`` and its old association is dropped. The trace carries no
event that links a creation call to the child it made, only the id the call
returns, and a call's entry is not the child's allocation: an earlier
lifetime of the same id can still end while the call runs. So a child seen
writing while its parent's creation call ran is that call's child, since a
lifetime still writing has not released its id, but an end of the id before
the call returned could be either and leaves the collection ``incomplete``;
so does the id announced as attached more than once. A thread census entry,
timed by when its task directory was read, is the traced thread only when it
was read after the creation call returned, in the same process; read before
the call began it was an earlier lifetime, and read while the call ran it
could be either. Observations that cannot be placed leave the collection
``incomplete`` with the reason.
Whether the collection is complete is kept apart from what it showed:
``OracleOutcome.status`` is the collection, ``O2Result.state`` the verdict.

**What complete does not claim.** Collection completeness is evaluated from
the records strace emitted, not from an identity-complete kernel lifecycle log.
Exit-report timestamps need not be the instants when the corresponding
lifetimes ended or released their ids. An older lifetime reported late can
remain indistinguishable from a returned child when no separate new-lifetime
end or duplicate attachment is present; such histories are outside this
reconstruction's guarantee. H-R6 traces with no recorded creation calls do not
exercise birth reconciliation, and a row relying on a followed child's identity
needs separate validation before it counts as stronger evidence.

**What a signal was aimed at is what the call names.** Its class is the
sender's role and the kind of target the call names, read against the
watcher's records up to the send and never after it: a group number the
watcher had recorded for the principal (``principal-group``), a group or pid it
had recorded for one of the row's browsers while it was one, or for a process
by then known to carry such a browser's marker, the sender itself, or anything
else. ``principal-group`` means the call named a previously recorded
principal-group number: it is not proof that the group still belonged to the
principal, nor of the sender's intent, nor of any death. That is the Path A
witness, and it rests on the call alone: which processes a signal then reached
is a separate question.

**Who received a signal is known only when the samples show it.** The watcher
samples the process table; between two samples it sees nothing. A pid target is
pinned to a lifetime only when the same lifetime (pid and create time) is seen
in the samples on both sides of the send. A group target is pinned only when
every process in that group in either sample is seen in both, in that group
both times, the group did not exist at the watcher's first sample, and no
process could not be identified, and no member's group could not be read,
around the send. That is endpoint membership, not a continuous record: a
process that joined and left the group between the two samples is not seen,
so a ``held`` group under this rule is not an atomic census of every process
the signal reached.
A process a SIGKILL reached is gone by the next sample, so it can almost never
be pinned, and the traced O2 of a row whose guardian drained its browser groups
usually reads ``unknown``. That is the oracle's stated limit, not a pass: the
kernel's last allocated pid, which the watcher logs, is a cursor and no proof
that a pid was not reused, so nothing else stands in for the second sample.

**A browser's marker is its launch.** On Linux, Chromium's crashpad handler
double-forks out of the browser's tree, carrying the browser's environment and
with it the random marker the product sets per launch, which is what the
guardian drains by. A process carrying the marker of one of the row's browsers
is in that browser's launched set, from the moment the watcher knew the marker.

**The traced O2** is ``violated`` when a pinned recipient is outside the
sender's launched set (its principal, the server or owner it belongs to, and
that principal's descendants), ``unknown`` when a recipient could not be
pinned, and ``held`` only when every recipient was pinned inside it. A call
that returned an error other than ``ESRCH`` is an attempt, not a delivery; one
aimed outside the set is still a violation, as an attempt. ``ESRCH`` reached
nobody, and signal 0 is a liveness probe. A signal is evidence of a signal,
not of a death: deaths are only what was observed.

**Across experiments** a row's classes are compared with those Direct's actors
send by construction (``DIRECT_CLASSES``) and those the Direct reference
actually sent: the pre-Path-A guardian's ``killpg`` of the owner's group names
the principal's group, which no Direct guardian does.

**Canaries** are processes the harness starts before the row in a session of
their own (POSIX) or outside every Job it can leave (Windows). One that dies
during the row died from something no actor should have sent.
