"""Profile commands beside a live owner: the driver, the verdicts, the rows'
wiring and the model mapping.

No browser. The **driver** runs a stand-in CLI as a real child on a real
pseudo-terminal or on real pipes. The **synthetic browser** is found and
ranked by the product's own discovery. The **verdicts** start from an
explicit valid record of each row and change one observation at a time,
the plan's controls among them. The **wiring** runs the real row entry on
modelled actors with a host double whose reads are real requests to a real
origin, held at its real gates, while the row's own script drives the
stand-in CLI through the real seams. The **model mapping** names tests that
exist.
