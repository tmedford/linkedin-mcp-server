"""The post-quit session starts only when every actor of the row is settled.

Driven through the real row entry, ``measure_host_quit_row``, with everything
that would launch, signal or touch an owner replaced: staging, the watcher
process, the host session, owner discovery, cleanup and the post-quit session
itself. What runs for real is the profile census over a modelled process
table, the gate, and the row's own continuation. Only the census and the
watcher's summary differ between cases, and the question is whether the
post-quit session was started.
