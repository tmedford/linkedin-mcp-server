"""H-R3's and H-R2's verdicts, their producer and their place in the row.

Three families, none of them with a browser. The **contract** tests start
from an explicit, valid raw record per row, mode and platform, change one
observation, and run the verdict the row runs (``host_comparison.r3_problems``
and ``r2_problems``); none derives its expectation from the verdict. The **producer** tests run ``harness.observe_checkpoint`` over a
modelled process table and hand what it read to that verdict. The **wiring**
tests go through the real row entry, ``measure_host_quit_row``, on the
preservation gate's modelled row, with the host session and the checkpoint
reader replaced by doubles that keep the real seams: the row's own script,
its post-exit hook, its settlement gate and its published ``failures.json``.
For H-R2 the second host goes through that same host seam, started by the
row's own script, and every read adds a request to the origin while it runs.
