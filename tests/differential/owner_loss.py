"""The owner lost before dispatch (H-R8) and after dispatch of a mutating
tool (H-R9).

**H-R8, the owner unreachable before dispatch.** The host warms up through
the owner with the row's feed read; then, between calls, the row takes the
owner the frontend is attached to out of service, and the host reads
``get_person_profile`` (the calibrated read, ``call_loss``) for a username
of the lane's own. The frontend's heartbeat preflight is the first thing a
call sends, and only a validated 200 dispatches it, so every lane here asks
the same question: the preflight fails, no tool request reaches the failed
instance, and recovery serves the read on an owner that can. Each lane in
K1 frozen (the same host requests through Direct, no hop and no fault: a
Direct server has no owner to lose), K3 and K0.

* **Unreachable** (``H-R8-unreachable``): the harness kills the identified
  owner through the handle the row tied it by, waits for its death and
  reads it gone, then the host calls. Its own lane: the H-R6 mapping is not
  credited (plan F8). The preflight goes unanswered, recovery elects a
  successor, and the read succeeds there.
* **Owner error** (``H-R8-owner-error``, POSIX only): the harness stops the
  identified owner (SIGSTOP), calls, sees the frontend's preflight fail,
  and resumes the owner (SIGCONT) ``STOP_SECONDS`` after the stop, on every
  path, the teardown included. The stopped owner may stay eligible:
  recovery may wait for it, which delivers the read on that owner once it
  runs again, or fail explicitly; neither runs anything on it while it is
  stopped. A later read then works. Windows has no portable stop: a
  reasoned skip.
* **Declared responder** (``H-R8-responder-404``, ``H-R8-responder-500``):
  native transport, synthetic answer. The owner is killed as above and a
  loopback listener of the row's own (``DeclaredResponder``) is bound on its
  old address, answering every request with the lane's status. Port not
  bound again: invalid evidence. The real frontend meets it, real election
  publishes a successor on its own port, and only the successor receives
  the tool dispatch. The responder records every request it gets, so a
  dispatch reaching it, which carries the call's header on a path other
  than the heartbeat's, is seen. These cells claim the classification and
  zero dispatches to the failed instance, and a burial category only where
  the frontend's own line shows one (``BURIAL_LINE``): a 500 buries nothing
  in the frontend, while the election may write the responder off locally
  once its listing fails, and a successor alone proves neither.
* **Retiring**: PR 2's retirement-wins lanes (``RETIRING_ELSEWHERE``), not
  duplicated here.

What a frontend's output says is all that classifies: the preflight line
and its class where it names one, the election's and the replay's lines,
the burial line. An unanswered preflight's line names no class, so
``unreachable`` and ``owner_error`` are told apart only in the unit matrix
(``UNIT_MATRIX``), which also keeps every other classification. A dispatch
to the dead owner of the kill lanes is excluded, not observed: that owner
was confirmed dead before the call was sent, the frontend reported its
failed preflight and then replayed a call it had not sent, and every page
of the read arrived after the successor's launch (``UNOBSERVED``).

**H-R9, the owner lost after dispatch.** ``send_message`` with
``confirm_send`` to a synthetic recipient, a mutating tool whose first
navigation is the recipient's profile page. The origin holds that page
(``synthetic_origin.person_path``, the person page every read here gets),
and once it entered, K1 frozen kills the Direct server through its tied
handle and K3 kills the identified owner, the frontend alive. The hold is
released ``RELEASE_SECONDS`` after its entry, below the gate's deadline.
K3: an error result with ``status`` ``outcome_unknown`` and ``retry_safe``
false, no second navigation to the recipient's page (no replay), then a
read through the same host on a verified successor. K1: the connection is
lost, the profile settles by itself before anything is cleaned up, and a
fresh host reads. Compared: no duplicate mutation dispatch, O1, O3 and O4.
The separate-process after-effect control stays where it is
(``AFTER_EFFECT_CONTROL``).

**Nothing of H-R9 reaches LinkedIn** (``FENCE``): the tool drives only the
browser, whose only egress is the row's proxy; the proxy tunnels the two
allowed names to the loopback origin and refuses everything else; the CI
step maps those names to loopback and the native cells refuse to start
otherwise; and the origin has no Message action on the profile page and
no messaging page at all, so the product's own resolution ends at
``message_unavailable``. The record keeps the hosts the proxy forwarded,
and the verdict holds them to the allowed names.

A loss before its trigger, a hold that ran out its deadline, a stop never
resumed, a responder never bound or never met, a reading out of its window:
invalid evidence (``INVALID``), apart from a finding. K2 is recorded not
applicable for every row here. The scripts run on a ``harness.RowContext``
with its ``owner_loss`` seams; nothing here reads a process, and the
verdicts read the raw record alone, so each can be replayed from the
published packet.
