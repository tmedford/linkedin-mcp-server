"""What a host's quit leaves, read at checkpoints: rows H-R3 and H-R2.

**The row.** The host actions are H-R1's: start, one ``get_feed`` call, stdin
EOF. What H-R3 adds is three readings of the profile around that quit, taken
by the harness (``harness.observe_checkpoint``) and judged here from the raw
record alone, so the verdict can be replayed from the published packet:

* ``before quit``: from the row's script, after the read returned;
* ``first post-exit``: from the host stub's post-exit hook, once the server
  has exited on EOF and before the stub waits for its stderr to close;
* ``settled``: after the owner's own exit (daemon) and a bounded passive wait
  for the profile's browser, before any cleanup, sweep or preservation.

**Freshness is measured from the send.** An expectation that depends on the
actor not having idled out yet holds only while the checkpoint *ends* inside
the idle timeout, less a margin, counted from when the harness sent the last
call. Receipt would be later than the actor's own quiet origin and could
hide an ordinary idle exit, so the earlier send is the conservative anchor.
A late window is an evidence failure, never a finding about the product, and
nothing in it is judged.

**Roots are the watcher's.** ``census_roots`` applies ``watcher.browser_roots``
to the census, so a renderer inside a root's tree is no root of its own. The
census itself is kept whole: an unresolved process, or an entry whose parent
or start could not be read, leaves the root count unknown, never zero.

**Capabilities are the platform's, not the record's.** The lock contender
(``lease_probe``) answers on POSIX, so Linux and macOS must answer at every
checkpoint that claims a lock state; only Linux can name the holder
(``lock_association``). Windows lock state is ``unobserved`` and is never
credited as held or free.

Direct and the daemon differ in one place: after the host's exit the Direct
server has closed its browser, while the owner keeps it until its own idle
exit. Direct's first post-exit reading is kept as it was read, even when it
is not yet empty and settlement follows; the daemon's must still show the
owner, its root and the held lock, in a fresh window. Neither mode needs the
browser or the lease to outlive the owner's process: at settlement the owner
has exited by itself and the profile is empty and free.

**H-R2** puts a second host, B, inside A's life on the same profile, with
the same launch: A reads (A1), B starts, reads and quits, A reads again (A2)
and quits. Its checkpoints are ``after A1``, ``after B quit`` (from B's own
post-exit hook), then A's ``first post-exit`` and ``settled``. Every read has
to be served by a request that arrived inside its own interval
(``attribute_requests``). In daemon mode the hot reuse is the claim: one
owner lifetime and instance throughout, B forwarding to it, and each gap
fresh from the last send; a late gap says the reuse was not observed.

No process is read here: this module holds readers and verdicts only.
