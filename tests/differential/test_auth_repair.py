"""Auth repair and the login beside an owner: the staged sign-in, the
lineage, the judgement, the verdicts, the rows' wiring, the relay's boundary
and the model mapping.

No browser. The **sign-in** is the real synthetic origin over loopback TLS,
asked by a plain client that trusts the run's CA in its own context only.
The **lineage** reads real profiles on disk. The **judgement** is the real
``judge_row``. The **verdicts** start from an explicit valid record of each
cell and change one observation at a time, the plan's controls among them.
The **wiring** runs the real row entry in Direct mode, and the real scripts
on a modelled owner, with a product double whose requests are real requests
to the real origin: it meets the real wall, asks the real completion, and
writes a real session to disk. The **relay** is real sockets in this
process. The **model mapping** names tests that exist.
