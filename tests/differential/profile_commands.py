"""Profile commands beside a live owner (H-R10a, H-R10b) and ``--status``
with one (H-R15).

**The command is the product's own.** Each one is the row's own command line
with ``--logout``, ``--login``, ``--import-from-browser`` or ``--status``,
in the row's own environment, run as a child of the harness
(``TerminalCommand``). The confirmed retirement asks only on an interactive
terminal (``config.is_interactive``: stdin *and* stdout a TTY), so a row
that answers it runs the command on a pseudo-terminal: its stdin, stdout
and stderr are the terminal's slave side, the harness reads the master side
and writes an answer only once the prompt it answers has been read. The
banner the CLI prints only when interactive is what shows the command saw a
terminal. Reads and writes are bounded; the transcript is kept as it came,
each line stamped on the monotonic clock, and nothing in it is a secret: the
commands print paths, versions and their own messages. POSIX only: Windows
has no pseudo-terminal without a new dependency, so there the cells that
need one are counted skips (``NO_TERMINAL_ON_WINDOWS``) and confirmed
retirement stays with the manual protocol's profile-command steps. A
command on pipes (``--status``, and the no-terminal cell) runs everywhere.

**H-R10a, logout beside an idle owner** (``ROW_LOGOUT``). K1 frozen: the
host reads and quits, the Direct server and its browser settle by
themselves (read, never swept), and then ``--logout`` on the terminal,
deletion confirmed: the session is cleared. K3: the host reads through the
owner and quits; the owner stays alive and idle, the row's idle timeout far
from running out; ``--logout`` on the terminal, deletion confirmed, then a
checkpoint showing the owner alive and holding the profile right before the
retirement is confirmed; the owner retires on that request (its exit, and
its own stand-down line, never its idle line), and the logout clears once
the profile is free. Both expect R17 ``cleared-by-user``: the row records
the confirmation (``LOGOUT``) and R17 reads the clear from the artefacts.
Nothing that could sign in again runs after it (``must-remain-cleared``).

Two daemon cells beside it, K1 not applicable (a Direct server records no
shared browser, so nothing asks about retiring one): **retirement
declined** (``ROW_DECLINE``, terminal): exit 0, no retirement request (the
idle owner, which would have retired on one, is still the same lifetime
holding the profile, and its log has no stand-down line), no operation, the
session retained; and **no terminal** (``ROW_NO_TERMINAL``, pipes): the
command says retirement needs a terminal, sends nothing, and the ordinary
profile checks decide. A refusal there is asserted only when checkpoints
around the run show the profile positively held; elsewhere the outcome is
recorded.

**H-R10b, the same commands beside a busy owner** (``ROW_BUSY``, POSIX). The
host's person read is held at the origin, a section at a time, and while
each section is held one command runs with every confirmation: logout,
then login, then import. K3: each is refused on the busy path (409), exit
1, its message names no process, nothing is deleted or rotated, no browser
is launched, the owner is untouched; the import's refusal comes before any
browser profile is discovered or read (no keychain notice, no discovery or
extraction line), from a discovery root that is a disposable synthetic
browser of the row's own (``synthetic_browser``). K1 frozen follows the
frozen Direct's own policy at its lease: logout and import refuse there,
and login may wait for the lease, which the row bounds and ends itself
before the held read is released, so the login can never take the profile.
Each section is released only after its command ended; the held read then
completes normally. Queued-busy and every other branch the native cells do
not reach are mapped to their models (``MODEL_COVERAGE``).

**H-R15, ``--status`` beside a live owner** (``ROW_STATUS``, every
platform, on pipes). The host reads and stays open; a checkpoint, the
status, another checkpoint, and the host reads again. Exit 1 with the
contention category (K3 the product's own two lines, K1 frozen its own old
wording: categories compared, never text), no browser launched, no origin
request inside the status run, the session unchanged. A successful status
while the profile was not shown held around the run is a recorded timing
branch, invalid for the contention claim, not a finding; a successful
status while it was shown held is a finding.

K2 is recorded not applicable for every row here (``K2_NOT_APPLICABLE``).
The scripts run on a ``harness.RowContext`` with its ``commands`` seams;
nothing here reads a process, and the verdicts read the raw record alone,
so each can be replayed from the published packet. Invalid evidence starts
with ``INVALID``, apart from a finding.
