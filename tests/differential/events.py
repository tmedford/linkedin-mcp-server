"""The differential harness's event log and its case counts.

One ``events.jsonl`` per pytest run, one record per line, every record carrying
``{t, run, experiment, row, platform, actor, kind}`` and whatever the kind adds.
Records come from three writers that share no memory: the harness itself, the
watcher process, and the synthetic origin's request log, which the harness
copies in after a row. ``t`` is wall-clock seconds for that reason, since the
watcher runs in another process and a monotonic clock is not comparable across
processes.

``counts.json`` says how many cases ran, skipped and failed per experiment, row,
platform and column. A gate that reads "no difference" from a row that never ran
is the failure it exists to expose, so a skipped case is counted, not dropped.
