"""Configurations the daemon must refuse (H-R12 remainder), and a rival owner
of the same build with another configuration (H-R14).

**H-R12 remainder.** Each cell runs one configuration the contract keeps on
the Direct server it had before the daemon existed, in every column the same
(``CASES``): the daemon switched off by ``DAEMON_ENABLED=false`` and by
``--no-daemon``; a container (``LINKEDIN_MCP_CONTAINER=true``, the session
staged and preserved as the same runtime); an HTTP server
(``--transport streamable-http``, reached by the harness's HTTP host,
``harness.HttpHost``); and storage the product's own classifier refuses,
from provider metadata the cell plants for its whole run: a Dropbox
``info.json`` naming the row's temporary auth root (synced), one naming the
computed daemon state root (only the state synced), a malformed one
(unknown), and on macOS a profile under ``~/Library/CloudStorage``. K3 runs
the candidate with the daemon enabled; K1 frozen runs the pinned baseline
Direct under the same configuration and reads the same way. Every cell must
show no coordination effect: no owner launched and no release gate, counted
the Windows-safe way (``host_comparison.owner_launches``); no forwarding
line and no election; no daemon state for the row's auth root and no
descriptor; a successful read whose every page went through a browser the
row's own server launched (``harness.browser_lineage``), never credited by
process timing; and R17 retained. K3 also has to say why, once: the
product's own refusal line for a container or for each storage class,
naming the root it refused. The classification of the profile, its auth
root and the state root is read with the product's own classifier during
the row (``storage_reading``), so a configuration that was not in effect is
invalid evidence and never a pass.

What a native cell cannot show stays with its models (``MODEL_COVERAGE``):
that no descriptor was read and no transient lock taken (the coordination
traps of ``tests/test_daemon.py``), and non-local mounts, for which no
rootless fixture exists on a hosted runner.

**H-R14.** Host A reads with ``LOGIN_TIMEOUT=1800``; host B starts while A
is open, with an equal build and ``LOGIN_TIMEOUT=1801``, a fingerprinted
field, and the same small ``BROWSER_MIN_HOLD`` in both columns, which is
not. B reads a person profile of its own and quits; A then reads another.
K3: B probes the owner A elected once and falls back to Direct (its own
fallback line, counted apart from forwarding), never forwards, reads
through the profile lease's handoff with a browser of its own, and quits;
A reads again through the same owner, whose identified lifetime and
instance are unchanged and which started no turnover. K1 frozen: A, B
Direct and A again, each through its own server's browser. Each of the
three reads is credited to the browser that read its own pages; an owner
that idled out before A2 is an idle timeout too small for the runner,
invalid evidence and never a finding.

K2 is recorded not applicable for every cell here: the contract's named K2
set holds only ``CHROME_PATH`` for R12, delivered in ``test_frozen_rows``.
The scripts run on a ``harness.RowContext`` with its ``coordination``
seams; the verdicts read the raw record alone, so each can be replayed from
the published packet. Invalid evidence starts with ``INVALID``.
