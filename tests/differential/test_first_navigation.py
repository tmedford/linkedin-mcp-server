"""The first-navigation evidence names the phase, and keeps the failure.

Every browser here is a real Chromium on a disposable empty profile, against
a loopback origin this module serves, never LinkedIn and never the synthetic
origin's CA. Each stalled or lost case still fails exactly as it would
unobserved, and the evidence says where it stood. The harness cases run the
real row entry with its staging made to fail before any row record exists.

The browser cases skip where no Chromium is installed, as the other
``browser_contract`` tests do; CI's full suite installs one.
