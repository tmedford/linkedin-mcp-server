"""Case accounting for the differential harness, from pytest's own reports.

A plugin rather than a fixture, because a fixture is only set up for a case
that gets that far: a run where every native row skips before setup never
instantiates one, and its counts would never be written. Here the counts are
built from the report hooks and written at session finish, whatever ran.

**A case's verdict is all of its phases.** Pytest reports setup, call and
teardown separately, and a finalizer that fails runs after the call already
passed. So a case is ``failed`` if any phase failed, ``skipped`` if setup or
call skipped, and ``executed`` only when its call passed and nothing failed
around it. The verdict is taken at session finish, after the last teardown.

**Under xdist the controller counts.** Workers attach the case's marker to each
report as a user property, which xdist forwards to the controller with the
report; the controller aggregates and writes one ``counts.json``. Workers write
no counts of their own. The native rows refuse to run under xdist at all, so
their event log and counts always come from one process.

The evidence directory is created lazily, under pytest's base temporary
directory, and copied to ``LINKEDIN_MCP_DIFFERENTIAL_OUT`` at the end when that
is set (``events.publish`` decides which files go).
