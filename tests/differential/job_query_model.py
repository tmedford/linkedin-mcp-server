"""H-R11's routine branch as a source model: the exact functions, Win32 doubles.

**Claim.** At the routine drain's decision point for one member of the
adopted Job, where no Job the owner holds claimed the member and at least one
of them could not be asked, the baseline selects ``TerminateProcess`` for it
and the candidate counts it as remaining and does not. Around that branch both
revisions keep the same positive controls: a member a held Job claims is
spared, a later positive answer outweighs an earlier failure, a member known
to be in no held Job is still ended, an unanswered inventory, open or
membership query is never read as empty, the owner and the idle id are never
opened, the gate is never ended and every handle opened is closed.

**Evidence.** ``source-model``. The definitions of ``_drain_exclusions``,
``_in_another_owned_job`` and ``_drain_adopted_windows_job_members``, and of
``_windows_process_created`` where a revision has it, are taken
from each revision's source text and run, unchanged, against Win32 doubles
whose answers each case scripts per iteration of the drain. What the model
shows is the branch each revision's code selects in a modelled state. It
shows nothing about native API delivery, which process a native termination
ended, or O2 across the system; the native experiments
(``test_failed_job_query_row.py``) carry those, and no result of one kind is
counted as the other (review e1ex, E1EX-02).
