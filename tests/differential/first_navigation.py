"""Why a fresh browser's first navigation stalled, or why its browser went.

On Windows runners the first ``Page.goto`` of a fresh browser has run out
Patchright's 30s default, in the identity gate against plain loopback and in
the product's own import validation while a row stages its session. Rows have
also seen Chromium exit while its Node driver lived on, and O4 rows have lost
the staged session between staging and the row. Their packets show the
timeout and the loss, never the phase either was reached in. This module
records that phase. It fixes nothing: no timeout, retry or verdict reads what
it writes.

**Observers are there before the browser is.** ``observe_navigation`` wraps
Patchright's own ``launch_persistent_context``, ``Page.goto``,
``BrowserContext.close`` and the driver's stop in the process that drives
the browser, for as long as it is entered, and listens on every context the
launch returns before anything navigates. A listener asks the browser
nothing: the driver dispatches request and response events whether or not
anyone listens (a subscription only decides whether it forwards them to this
process), and page lifecycle events always reach it. No CDP session, init
script, route, header or launch flag is added, so the browser says what it
said before (AGENTS.md, Browser Identity Rules).

**Write-through.** Every observed step replaces the file at once, so what was
obtained survives a navigation that never returns, a page that closed, a
cancelled task, and a staging subprocess the harness kills. ``outcome`` stays
``running`` in a file whose writer never finished.

**Absent stays absent.** A phase not observed is null. ``stalled_phase`` is
the first of request, response, commit and DOMContentLoaded that had not been
observed when the first failed navigation gave up, never one filled in from
the timeout. A browser root's exit code is not known here, because no observer
is its parent, and the record says so. The driver's is read from Patchright's
own handle on it, whose process is its parent, and only once that handle has
one.

**Two lifetimes, kept apart.** ``LifetimeSampler`` runs in the harness
process beside whichever process stages, and reads this process's descendants
only: the browser root on the profile (``--user-data-dir`` naming it, no
``--type=``) and the root's parent, the driver. Each is an identity (pid and
create time) and an interval (identified, last seen alive, first seen gone).
Its end is read against the close the driving process asked for: gone before
any was asked for is ``unexpected``, and a sampling interval that straddles
the request is ``ambiguous``.

**The session's lineage is counted, never copied.** ``record_cookie_lineage``
reads the cookie file and the profile's own cookie store at named points:
entry counts, LinkedIn cookie names, and whether a ``li_at`` carries the
staged value, by digest equality. The store is opened read-only and immutable,
so nothing it holds or locks changes for the browser that opens it next. No
cookie value, header, raw event payload, or URL query or fragment reaches a
file.

**Bounded.** At most ``MAX_NAVIGATIONS`` navigations, ``MAX_EVENTS`` lifecycle
events, ``MAX_PROCESSES`` processes and ``MAX_READINGS`` readings per file;
the sampler stops within ``STOP_SECONDS``. A failure of an observer is
counted in its file and never raised into the operation it watches.

The three files are in ``events.PUBLISHED_FILES``. Stdlib only at import:
``baseline_stage.py`` runs ``observe_navigation`` under the frozen baseline's
interpreter, which has neither psutil nor anything of the candidate.
