"""The harness core: account boundary, watcher, host stub, and row H-R1.

**Account boundary.** Spawned actors use the account's *real* daemon state
root, because ``daemon_descriptor._account_home`` ignores ``HOME`` on purpose
and the owner is started by production code that has nowhere to inject a
redirection. What keeps them off the user's state is the key: the daemon
directory is a hash of the auth root, and every row's auth root is a fresh
temporary directory, so cleanup has one exact target (``daemon_dir``). This is
the policy of ``real_state_root`` in ``tests/test_daemon_election.py``.

The one auth root no row may ever use is the user's, ``~/.linkedin-mcp``.
``claim_account`` refuses it, and anything that contains it or sits inside it,
before a file is read, a browser launched or a process spawned. It judges the
path as written first, then the filesystem's own identity of every directory
involved, which is what catches a case alias on a case-insensitive volume or a
link. An account whose home cannot be determined is refused, not assumed
harmless. ``HOME`` is deliberately not redirected for the actors: on Linux the
bundled browser reads the trusted test CA from ``~/.pki/nssdb``, so a different
home would be a different trust store.

**Owner cleanup acts only on the owner this row identified.** Its pid, create
time, instance and auth root are recorded when the row finds it, and the
``psutil.Process`` taken then is the only handle cleanup ever signals. A
descriptor naming anything else, or an identity that no longer holds, is
refused and the row's daemon directory is kept as evidence.

**Host stub.** A real MCP client over stdio, spawning the server from this
virtual environment the way a host does. It is not ``fastmcp``'s own stdio
transport: that one starts the server in a new session and, when the client
leaves, closes stdin and then escalates to signals after two seconds (measured
again under FastMCP 4, whose default also keeps the server running past the
client unless ``keep_alive`` is off). A host
quit is stdin EOF and a wait, and a server closing a browser takes longer than
two seconds, so that transport would turn every host quit into a kill. This one
starts the server in the harness's own process group, where the child of a host
that does not detach it lands, and on quit closes stdin and waits. Not leading
a group matters: a Direct server that leads one hands its guardian that group
to signal (``process_tree.start_browser_guardian``), a different topology.

**Row H-R1** (normal start, one host, local storage, bundled browser): stage a
signed-in session, start the watcher, initialize, call one read tool, quit the
host, and wait for the server, the owner and the profile's browser to be gone.
In daemon mode the owner leaves through its own idle exit. Then, outside the
row's interval, one short Direct session on the same profile shows whether the
origin still accepts the staged session. Before and after, the R17 snapshot.

K1 here is a **same-revision Direct reference**: the server of this checkout
with the daemon off. The plan's **frozen K1** and **K2** run the pinned baseline
instead (``baseline.Runtime``), with its own interpreter, staging and browser,
and are labelled with its short SHA; the two K1 columns are kept apart.

**Row H-R12** (custom browser): the daemon enabled and ``CHROME_PATH`` set to
the runtime's own bundled Chromium, so the browser is the same binary and only
the setting differs. The candidate must show no coordination effect (no owner,
no forwarding, no daemon state) and the O1/O4 of the frozen Direct run with the
same setting; the baseline, in K2, must be caught coordinating
(``k2_r12_verdict``).

**Row H-R3** (host quit with an idle browser): H-R1's actions, read at three
checkpoints around the quit (``observe_checkpoint``): from the row's script
before it, from the host stub's post-exit hook, and once the actors have left
by themselves, before any cleanup. ``host_comparison`` judges the record.

**Row H-R2** (a second host while the first is open): host A reads, then its
script runs a second host, B, with the same command, environment and profile;
B reads and quits, and A reads again and quits. The checkpoints add one after
A1 and one from B's own post-exit hook.

**Row lifecycles** (``ROWS``): every row is declared before it may run, with
its first call, how its host is expected to end, what its preservation may
do, its idle timeout and, for a row that keeps a raw record, the verdict that
judges it (``ROW_VERDICTS``), appended after ``judge_row``. An undeclared row,
or a declaration that does not hold together, is refused before anything is
staged or spawned. A row declared since then runs its own script on a
``RowContext``; the scripts of H-R2, H-R3, H-R7 and H-R11 stay where they
are. **Row H-CAL** (``call_loss``) is the first such row: an unfaulted person
read through a held, then released, section page. **Rows H-R4 and H-R5**
lose that read once its held page entered, each by a termination of its own
(``RowLifecycle.termination``), through ``LossSeams``; a host killed whole
is a process of its own (``StubHost``). **Row H-R13** and the **turnover
lanes** (``retirement_race``) race the read against the owner's retirement,
idle or asked for, through ``RaceSeams``; a row whose call a successor may
serve settles that successor in the identified owner's place. **Rows H-R8 and
H-R9** (``owner_loss``) lose the owner before a call and after the dispatch of
a mutating one, through ``OwnerLossSeams``: killed or stopped through the
handle the row tied it by, or its old address answered by a declared
responder; a stopped owner is resumed on every path. **Rows H-R10a, H-R10b
and H-R15** (``profile_commands``) run the profile commands themselves, the
row's own command line with ``--logout``, ``--login``,
``--import-from-browser`` or ``--status``, on a pseudo-terminal or on pipes,
through ``CommandSeams``: a command not shown exited with its output ended
once the row is done with it is retained, and one the script leaves running
is ended by the teardown and recorded as a harness failure. **Rows H-R16
and H-R10a-login** (``auth_repair``) stage a sign-in at the synthetic origin
through ``AuthSeams``: the harness records each authorization with the
session read right after it, the teardown closes the sign-in so nothing
issues a session after the row, and R17's replacement lineage
(``session.replacement_lineage``) is judged beside the original generation's
outcome, never in its place. **The H-R12 remainder and H-R14**
(``eligibility_rows``) declare what they run with
(``RowLifecycle.environment``, ``runtime_environment``, ``arguments``,
``transport``): a configuration declared ineligible is held to Direct in
every column, an HTTP row's host is ``HttpHost``, and a rival row's script
starts its second host through ``CoordinationSeams.rival``. Every recorded
row keeps its server lifetimes (``frontend_lifetimes``), which tie a browser
to the host whose server launched it.

class RowContext:
    """What a declared row's script may use (``RowLifecycle.script``).

    Narrow on purpose: the host's timed call, its live transport, the origin
    and its proxy, the account, checkpoint readings, the event log and the
    owned-worker helpers. The owner stays the row's: ``owner`` reads the one
    the row identified, and nothing here replaces, signals or ends it. Nothing
    here cleans up either; the row's teardown releases every gate armed
    through ``hold``, whatever the script did or did not do.

    A held request is released by the script, on its own schedule, and never
    only after ``transport.host_quit``: that waits for the server's exit,
    which a request still held can keep from happening until its deadline.

    A row that loses its host mid-call (``RowLifecycle.termination``) also
    gets ``loss``: the one way it may end the host's server, and the passive
    readings it takes afterwards. A row that races the owner's retirement
    (``RowLifecycle.race``) gets ``race``: its readings, and on a turnover
    lane the stand-down. A row that loses the owner
    (``RowLifecycle.owner_loss``) gets ``owner_loss``: the kill, the stop and
    the declared responder, and its readings. A row that runs profile
    commands (``RowLifecycle.commands``) gets ``commands``, a row that
    stages a sign-in (``RowLifecycle.auth``) gets ``auth``, and a row that
    reads how the frontend decided (``RowLifecycle.coordination``) gets
    ``coordination``.

    *runtime* is the code the actors run: this checkout by default, or the
    frozen baseline, whose actors, staging and browser are all its own.
    *custom_browser* sets ``CHROME_PATH`` to that runtime's bundled Chromium.
    *kill_actor* makes it H-R6: after the call the harness kills the owner
    (daemon) or the server (Direct), through the handle it took when it tied
    that process to the watcher's record of it, with the signal oracle
    attached to it and its guardian first; in daemon mode the host then calls
    again, which is where the frontend recovers.
    *job_query_shim* makes it H-R11 (``job_query``): the actors start from that
    venv, whose declared shim fails the routine drain's Job-membership query;
    the browser cache is a row-private one of links; after the read the row
    holds a dependency back so the next call starts an installer that waits on
    a host that never answers, then calls ``close_session`` with it running.
    In daemon mode, once the installer family has settled, the row restores
    the cache and calls once more, where a successor would serve. What the
    row established is ``RowResult.continuation`` (``NativeContinuation``).
    *unconfirmed_close* makes it H-R7 (``unconfirmed_close``): the actors start
    from the setup's fault overlay with the idle close off; after the read the
    row identifies the original actor, its guardian, the launch marker and the
    profile lock, attaches the trace, activates the fault and sends
    ``close_session``, then takes the lease checkpoints and, in daemon mode,
    recovers once the original owner and guardian are gone and the lock is
    free. Whatever still serves is ended after measurement, since nothing
    idles out, and that settling and the teardown after it run whole even
    when the row is cancelled, the cancellation raised only once they are
    done. What it established is ``RowResult.unconfirmed``.
    *row* ``H-R3`` (``host_comparison``) keeps H-R1's actions and takes three
    checkpoints: from the script before the quit, from the host stub's
    post-exit hook, and after the actors left by themselves and the profile's
    browser was waited for passively, before any cleanup. Its record is
    ``RowResult.comparison``, judged after ``judge_row``; none of the three
    scenarios above combines with it. *row* ``H-R2`` does the same around a
    second host: after the first read the script runs host B with the same
    command and environment, reads once more and quits, with checkpoints after
    A1 and from B's own post-exit hook. Both use
    ``COMPARISON_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``.

    Every *row* is declared in ``ROWS``; an undeclared one, a declaration
    that does not hold together, or a scenario the row does not combine with
    is refused before anything is staged or spawned (``declared_row``). A
    declared row's first call is its ``RowLifecycle.initial``, its
    preservation obeys its policy, and a row with a ``script`` runs it on a
    ``RowContext`` and keeps the raw record its ``ROW_VERDICTS`` entry judges
    (``RowResult.record``), whose held requests the teardown releases.
    *idle_timeout* is the row's declared one unless given, and is the one
    value staging, the actors, the owner's exit wait, the judgement and the
    record read.

    No row starts while anything an earlier row left is unsettled
