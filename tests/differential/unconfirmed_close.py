"""Row H-R7's own evidence: a close the product cannot confirm, by a declared fault.

**The setup.** Every actor starts from a fault overlay (``fault_overlay``) of
its runtime, with ``BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT=0`` from startup (E1EZ-01). After the
first read the harness identifies the original actor (the Direct server or
the owner), its guardian, the browser's launch marker (kept in memory, only
its digest written) and the profile lock, starts the external trace, and only
then publishes the activation (``publish_activation``) and sends
``close_session``. The fault hands that one close's real True back as False,
so the product proceeds as if the browser had not gone.

**Three kinds of evidence, never added up.** The *source model*
(``alias_model``) runs the declared fault against each runtime's exact
``process_tree`` in this process. The *native continuation*
(``R7Continuation``) is what the row observed of the actors: the selected
call and its consumption, the lease checkpoints, the guardian, the recovery.
The *phase reading* (``read_phase``) is the original actor's traced signals
after the real drain returned; the whole row's O2 stays the vector's, a
shared prefix read separately.

**Clocks.** The fault dates the real drain's return on the monotonic clock,
strace dates every line on the realtime one. The harness samples both,
bracketing each read (``clock_sample``), before the trace, after the close
and after the trace. One offset must fit every sample, or the realtime clock
stepped and nothing is placed. A traced call is in the phase only when it was
entered after the latest possible return, before it only when the trace
bounds its return before the earliest (``place``); anything else is
ambiguous, never resolved by a tolerance.

**Workers, helpers and resources stay owned.** Every blocking step runs on a
thread the row owns (``run_owned``), the lease contender's helper is owned by
``lease_probe``, and a tracer, child, owner or guardian the row could not
show ended is retained (``retain``). ``gate`` refuses the next measurement
while any of them is not shown finished, whatever the failure to settle was.
A cleanup holds every cancellation until it has run whole (``Deferral``).
