"""Losing the host mid-call: the losses, the stub host, the verdict, the rows.

No browser. The **losses** run through the real ``run_host_session`` and
``run_stub_host_session`` against a stand-in stdio server that holds a call
open and, as it exits, says whether its stdin ended and whether its stdout
could still be written: what a server can observe of each loss. The
**verdict** starts from an explicit valid record of each losing row and
changes one observation at a time. The **wiring** runs the real row entry in
Direct mode on the preservation gate's modelled actors, with a host double
whose reads are real requests to a real origin, so the row's own script
arms, waits for, loses, releases and watches a real gate.
