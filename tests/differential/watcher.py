"""A process watcher that runs outside every actor it observes.

Started by the harness as its own process: its own session on POSIX, its own
process group on Windows, and never a descendant of the server, the owner or
the browser. What it reports therefore does not depend on anything those actors
say about themselves. It samples the whole process table and writes
``process.start`` and ``process.exit`` for every process that appeared after
its first sample, keyed by pid *and* create time, so a recycled pid reads as
one exit and one start rather than as the same process.

It also derives O1 on every sample: how many browser tree roots each
``--user-data-dir`` has. A browser is found by that flag in its command line,
which Patchright passes to every persistent-context launch; a Chromium child
carries ``--type=`` and is part of its parent's tree, never a root of its own.
Two roots with the same profile in one sample is the second concurrent browser
the default-on contract forbids.

For O2 it records each process's group and, on POSIX, a digest of the browser
marker the product sets per launch, read once from every process started after
the first sample that could be the row's browser. That marker is what ties
Chromium's crashpad handler, which leaves the browser's tree for a session of
its own, to the browser that started it.

**Nothing a row could still change is settled by age.** A process can exec at
any moment of its life, and a forked child shows its parent's command line
until it does, which is how the Node driver starts Chromium on POSIX. So every
row actor, and every process not established as unrelated, has its executable
and command line read again on every sample for as long as it lives, and a
change is reported as
``process.update``. Its identity is checked on every sample either way.
Windows differs: nothing there can exec, and the parent pid a process records
at creation never changes, so once its parent, executable and command
line have all been read they are carried for the rest of that lifetime rather
than read again (``Sampler.no_exec``). What stays is the per-sample identity
check, which is also what reports its exit. A field that could not be read is
read again on every sample, as anywhere else.

**What a lifetime is cannot change, so it is asked once.** Its owning user is
read once per pid and create time, and a lifetime a full read found gone
(``NoSuchProcess``) is not read again, however long its pid stays listed.
The paths it names, its executable and its profile, are resolved once per
lifetime and spelling, and forgotten when the lifetime ends
(``Sampler._resolve``). Every read is timed, and each sample's time is charged to its phases
(``SAMPLE_PHASES``). The summary names the slowest read, keeps every sample of
at least ``SLOW_SAMPLE_SECONDS`` with its phases, and keeps the largest gap
between two samples with what the time outside sampling went to
(``BETWEEN_STEPS``) and the phases of the sample that closed it.

**The loop between samples makes no file-system call.** On a Windows runner
a stop-file check has blocked for 1.23s at no CPU while sampling waited for
it. So the stop file is polled by a thread of its own (``StopWatch``), and
events are serialized, written and flushed by another (``EventWriter``), in
the order the samples produced them; the loop reads an event and hands each
sample's events to a bounded queue. What those threads' calls took is in the
summary's ``file_io``, and what of it fell inside the largest gap is in that
gap's record, so a slow file system still shows without holding sampling.

**When each sample was taken is part of the evidence.** The summary's
``sample_log`` gives every sample's start, its end (the time its events
carry) and, on Linux, the last pid the kernel had allocated as it began; the
ready line lists the process groups of the first sample. A process settled as
unrelated still has its group read on every sample, and a change is reported.
A group that could not be read is published as unread (``pgid`` None, with
``pgid_error``) and listed in the summary; the last group read never stands in
for it. A process whose group read finds it gone is an exit. Group membership
is what the samples saw at their ends, not a continuous record: a process that
joined and left a group between two samples is not seen. The kernel's last
pid is a diagnostic only.

**Relevant means descended from the harness.** A process is a row actor when it
descends from the harness (``--root-pid``), whether it was already running at
the first sample, as a staging leftover would be, or appeared later.

**Unrelated has to be established; not being able to attribute is not it.** A
process is established as unrelated to the row when

* its owning user can be read and is not the harness's user (the real uid on
  POSIX, the user name on Windows), since no actor runs as anyone else; or
* it was running at the first sample and its whole ancestry, read then, ends
  at a child of pid 0 without passing the harness, every parent present and
  no younger than its child. A child of pid 1 is not enough, since an orphan
  of the harness is adopted there, and nothing but a wall-clock create time
  would say it is older than the harness; or
* on Windows, it was running at the first sample, its executable and command
  line were both read then, it names no profile and cannot be the browser.
  Windows has no exec, so that image is the process's for its whole lifetime
  (``Sampler.no_exec``); or
* on Windows, outside the row, its executable was read and cannot be the
  browser, even if its command line could not be read: that image can never
  be a browser root. The failed read is recorded once and not repeated (as
  for ``LsaIso.exe``, whose command line psutil retries for a second); or
* its executable, read in the same sample, is neither the row's browser
  (``--browser-exe``) nor anything under the managed browsers
  (``--browser-dir``). That is the setuid ``/bin/ps`` the product runs on
  macOS: psutil cannot read its arguments, and it cannot be a browser.

A process is never excluded merely because its calendar creation time precedes
the harness's: the calendar clock can be stepped, and a process born after the
harness can then read as older. Creation times still identify sampled lifetimes
and reject apparently younger parent records; passing that rejection is not an
independent proof of a historical parent-child relationship.

**An exclusion belongs to one lifetime.** The first three last: they are kept
by pid *and* create time, and apply only in a sample that read that same create
time, so a pid that cannot be identified now is not covered by what was
established about an earlier process there. The last holds for its sample
only, since a POSIX process can exec later. Evidence that ties a kept exclusion
to the harness withdraws it. A process already running at the first sample that
none of these settles is not excluded but read again on every sample, and
counts as a possible actor once it shows the browser.

Losing a process (``NoSuchProcess``, or a pid whose create time changed) is an
exit. Any other process whose identity, parent or arguments cannot be read, or
that cannot be opened at all, is an **unresolved possible actor**: it is kept in
the census, recorded, and leaves O1 unestablished for the row. That record stays
even if the process later becomes readable or exits, since a later reading
cannot show what it did while unreadable. Only a later reading of the same
lifetime, its create time equal to the one recorded, that shows another user
resolves it; a record without a create time has no lifetime to match and
stays. Every failed read is recorded in the summary, with the executable when
known, the fields, how long it lasted, how it ended and whether it could have
been a browser.

**A known browser root stays in its profile's count.** A lifetime read before
as a browser root on a profile keeps that reading, profile included, when a
later read of its arguments fails while its executable, read in the same
sample, is unchanged; macOS refuses the arguments of a process on its way out.
The profile is pinned rather than derived again from the old arguments, which
could now resolve elsewhere. Pinned there, the lifetime still counts toward
that profile, as a root or inside a same-profile parent's tree that is counted,
so it cannot hide a second root *on that profile*. It says nothing about any
other: a same-image exec with hidden arguments could have moved it onto one.
So the failed read is kept in ``read_failures`` as retained history with its
``retained_profile``, one note for each profile the lifetime was retained on,
not as a possible browser, and whoever judges a profile treats it as
unidentified unless that is the profile it names. Every other
failed argument read stays uncertain, including one of a lifetime read before
as a driver, helper or renderer: an exec since could have made it a root.

What sampling cannot see: a process that lives and dies between two samples.
The summary records when observation began and ended and the largest wall-clock
gap between two samples, so a claim built on it can state the window it had; an
overlap wholly between samples remains outside this oracle's resolution. On
Windows the watcher runs ahead of the row (``SCHEDULING_CLASS``), so a burst of
process starts does not widen that window by keeping it waiting to run; the
summary's ``priority`` says what it ran at.

Imports nothing from the repository, so it runs as a plain script:
``python watcher.py --out FILE --stop FILE ...``.
