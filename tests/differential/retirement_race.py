"""Calls racing the owner's retirement: its idle exit (H-R13) and a turnover.

Both read ``get_person_profile`` with ``sections="experience,education"``,
the calibrated read (``call_loss``), for a username of the row's own, and hold
its pages at the synthetic origin (``SyntheticOrigin.hold``), never longer
than ``HOLD_CAP_SECONDS`` each, below the gate's deadline.

**H-R13** declares an idle timeout of its own, ``IDLE_RACE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``,
the same in K1 frozen, K3 and K0. It has to exceed the time from the owner's
publication to the first call it admits, or the owner retires before the row
began: then the row's owner was replaced before the race, which is invalid
evidence, never a finding. The margin is derived from the packet
(``idle_margins``): the descriptor's write time against the warm-up's send,
and the warm-up's end against the read's.

* **Admission wins** (``H-R13-admission``): the read is sent at once after
  the warm-up and its profile page is held from before the idle threshold
  until after it and the owner's connection grace (``OWNER_GRACE_SECONDS``),
  so an idle decision that ignored the call in flight would have cut it. The
  read must complete on the original owner, the browser's lifetime unchanged
  across the hold, with no refusal in between; only afterwards does the
  owner idle out, shown by its idle-exit line and its exit. K1: Direct's
  conditional idle close must not close the browser under the held call, and
  closes it only afterwards.
* **Retirement wins** (``H-R13-retirement``): the row waits for positive
  retirement, the owner's idle-exit line (and its exit, where seen), and
  only then calls through the still-live frontend. The call either recovers
  to a verified successor that this call started and that read the row's own
  pages, or fails explicitly; both are safe and kept apart as branches
  (``DELIVERED``, ``FAILED``). How the frontend classified the retired owner,
  ``retiring`` or unanswered, is recorded from its own output when it says.
  K1: the browser idled closed and the next call reopens it.

**Turnover** (daemon only): the row sends the owner the authenticated
stand-down with no body, the legacy unconditional form a newer build uses,
reading the token from the row's own auth root and never recording it. Its
30 s drain and unknown-outcome answer are the contract's policy, so K1 is
recorded not applicable (``K1_NOT_APPLICABLE``). These lanes turn over an
owner of this build and do not discharge W6, the upgrade of an
older-protocol owner (``W6_NOT_DISCHARGED``).

* **Drain** (``H-TURNOVER-drain``): admitted held work, released well inside
  the drain, completes normally; the owner then stands down, cutting nothing.
* **Refused** (``H-TURNOVER-refused``): with the drain still running, a new
  read is refused and recovered to a successor, or fails explicitly, and
  never runs on the retiring owner: none of its pages before that owner is
  seen gone.
* **Cut** (``H-TURNOVER-cut``): two held pages, each below the gate's
  deadline, carry the read past the drain. The owner cuts it, and the caller
  gets ``outcome_unknown`` with ``retry_safe`` false; nothing of the read goes
  on after the cut, and it is never replayed.
* **Queued** (``H-TURNOVER-queued``): as cut, with a second read sent before
  the stand-down and queued behind the held one. Cut before its body began,
  it gets the owner's signed not-run refusal and is recovered to a successor
  (or fails explicitly), told apart from the begun read's unknown outcome.

Every attempt the frontend reports in its own output becomes an ``attempt``
event; nothing is counted from browser navigations. A deadline at a gate, a
retirement never seen, a stand-down never answered, a cut never made or a
reading taken out of its window is invalid evidence (``INVALID``), apart
from a finding. K2 is recorded not applicable for every row here.

The scripts run on a ``harness.RowContext`` with its ``race`` seams; nothing
here reads a process, and the verdicts read the raw record alone, so each can
be replayed from the published packet.
