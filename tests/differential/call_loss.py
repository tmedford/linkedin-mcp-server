"""Calls that lose their caller (H-R4, H-R5), and the read that calibrates
them (H-CAL).

**The read.** ``get_person_profile`` with ``sections="experience,education"``
navigates three pages in a fixed order, one per section
(``linkedin.fields.PERSON_SECTIONS``): the profile, then
``details/experience/``, then ``details/education/``, with a delay between
each. Holding the experience page at the synthetic origin
(``SyntheticOrigin.hold``) puts the call at a known point with one section
still to come, so whether the education page is requested after the hold
ends is what says whether the read went on.

**H-CAL** is that read with nothing taken away. The host warms up with the
row's ordinary feed read, which starts the browser (and in daemon mode the
owner) outside anything held; the script then arms the gate, reads the
profile through the host, releases the held page as soon as it entered, and
the host quits normally. Its verdict (``calibration_problems``) needs: the
gate entered and served, the held page the only experience request, the
education page requested after the hold let the held one go, the call returning
every section from its own page, and a normal quit. Settlement and the
preservation are the ordinary ones ``judge_row`` holds every row to. A gate
that ran out its deadline, or whose peer was gone, says the observation is
invalid, not that the product did anything.

**Paths the frozen baseline reads.** The same: at
``0253421539fffd4c9b207ca62b6efb41a8905ed3`` ``PERSON_SECTIONS`` names the
same three suffixes, and the navigation and capture code between them is
unchanged but for comments. The K1 cell does not lean on that reading: its
own record has to show the three requests the verdict requires.

**H-R4 and H-R5** read the same profile through the same held page, and lose
the call once the held request has entered the gate (``LOSS_CASES``):

* **EOF** (``H-R4-eof``): the host closes the server's stdin, with no MCP
  shutdown and no wait for its exit.
* **Abrupt pipe loss** (``H-R4-pipe``): stdin and the read end of stdout
  closed at once. Named pipe loss, not host death.
* **Host killed** (``H-R4-host-killed``): the host is a process of its own
  (``harness.StubHost``), killed whole, so its server finds every pipe broken.
  The observer stays outside it. Windows' real-host semantics stay the manual
  protocol's.
* **Two outstanding host requests** (``H-R4-two-requests``): a second read,
  for another username, sent once the first entered, then EOF. Nothing
  observes the second reaching the owner, so the row claims only that it
  never began; owner-queued abandonment stays with the source model.
* **Server or frontend killed** (``H-R5``), host alive: Direct, the server
  the host started; daemon, only the frontend, never the owner. Killed
  through the H-R6 path, guardian found and oracle attached before the read.

The row releases the held page ``RELEASE_SECONDS`` after its entry,
scheduled from the entry and never from the host, and then watches the
origin. The read going on shows as the education page requested after the
loss; the second read going on, as any of its pages. Direct: the server must
exit by itself, and its browser, census and, where the platform answers, its
lease are read before the harness ends anything. Daemon: the frontend must
exit by itself and the owner must stay the one identified, alive; a fresh
host then reads through that same owner inside ``HOT_REUSE_WINDOW_SECONDS``
of the loss, and the owner later idles out by itself. In both, a fresh host
reads after the loss, and the preservation is the ordinary one.

The cancellation cause is recorded, never inferred: the owner's expiry line
is evidence of expiry, its absence is ``unobserved``, and neither excuses a
continuation. The contract's bound, cancellation within the expiry and a poll
of the last heartbeat the owner registered, is not claimed: nothing outside
the owner observes that heartbeat. A gate that ran out, a release missed, a
loss before the entry, or a reading taken late is invalid evidence, named
apart from a product finding (``INVALID``).

The script runs on a ``harness.RowContext``; nothing here reads a process,
and the verdict reads the raw record alone, so it can be replayed from the
published packet.
