"""Browser-DOM tests for the job search sidebar scroll.

The unit suite mocks ``page.evaluate``, so the scrolling JS in
``scroll_job_sidebar`` never executes there. These tests run it against a
synthetic sidebar in headless chromium, where each scroll appends the next
batch of cards after a delay. That delay is the point: it stands in for the
user's connection, and the loop has to survive a batch that arrives later
than the previous one did. Skipped automatically when chromium is not
installed; run locally after ``uv run patchright install chromium --no-shell``.

    ``delays`` gives the delay of each successive batch in ms, so a fixture
    can vary latency the way a real connection does. The last value repeats.
    ``strays`` adds job links outside the rail, standing in for the detail
    pane's own permalink. ``links_per_card`` mirrors a card carrying both a
    title link and an overlay link to the same job. ``scrollable_pane`` puts
    those stray links in a container that scrolls on its own, which is what
    makes "first scrollable ancestor" the wrong container to pick.
    ``outer_scroller`` wraps the rail in a container that scrolls on its own
    and holds no cards of its own, the mirror image of ``wrap_cards``: it ties
    the rail's count from above rather than from below. ``strays_after`` puts
    the pane after the rail, which is the live order: candidates are reached
    through the cards, and the first job link on a real search page is a rail
    card. ``clone_on_scroll`` replaces the rail with an identical copy
    shortly after every scroll, holding the same cards, which is what a
    framework re-rendering during a slow batch looks like. ``short_rail``
    gives the rail room for every card it will hold, so it never overflows,
