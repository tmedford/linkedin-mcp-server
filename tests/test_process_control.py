"""The channel that carries an owner's commit authorization.

It exists because the configuration pipe cannot carry both. Every owner older
than the commit boundary frames its configuration by reading standard input to
end of file, so a parent that holds that pipe open for a later commit record
deadlocks against its own child after a package rollback. The record moves here
and the pipe ends on its content.

Two properties matter and neither is about throughput. Only the process that was
handed the post-spawn nonce may be authorized, because anything running as this
account can reach a loopback port. And closing without a record has to read as an
abort, because that is the authority the pipe used to carry: a parent that dies
before it validates must not leave a child that publishes anyway.
