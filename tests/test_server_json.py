"""Rules about ``server.json`` that only a reader of the registry can know.

``server.json`` is this server's entry for the *official* MCP Registry at
``registry.modelcontextprotocol.io``, which is a service published to with the
``mcp-publisher`` CLI. It is not the Docker MCP Catalog, whose entry for this
server is a ``server.yaml`` in the ``docker/mcp-registry`` repository and is
updated by opening a PR there. The two are routinely confused, including once
on the branch that added this file, so the distinction is written down rather
than assumed.

Nothing in the release publishes this file, so nothing in the release notices
when it goes wrong either: it can sit in the repository for months naming
something that was never released, and the first sign is a rejected publish.

The registry's own checks are the reason most of these rules exist. Publishing
proves that the publisher owns each package, and it proves it differently per
registry type. For PyPI it fetches the version's metadata and searches the
README, which PyPI stores as the package description, for the literal token
``mcp-name: <server name>``. For an OCI image it pulls the image *config* and
reads ``Config.Labels["io.modelcontextprotocol.server.name"]``, which is what a
Dockerfile ``LABEL`` writes. Manifest annotations are a different surface and
are not consulted, so a label replaced by an annotation would inspect correctly
and still fail verification. Both compare against the ``name`` in this file, so
three places have to agree and only one of them is JSON.

The token check is boundary-anchored, which is the part that surprises people:
a README declaring ``mcp-name: io.github.acme/widget-pro`` would otherwise
satisfy an ownership claim for the shorter ``io.github.acme/widget``, because
the shorter string is a substring of the longer one. The registry therefore
requires the matched name to be followed by end-of-content, a character that
cannot appear in a server name, or an HTML comment close. A token written
inline and ended with a period fails that, and the failure arrives as an
ownership error rather than a formatting one. Measured against
``internal/validators/registries/mcpname.go`` and ``oci.go``.
