"""The image's browser and process topology are part of its behaviour.

Building the real image is too expensive for the ordinary unit suite, and
string checks are enough for the pieces that can disappear silently: the
browser product, the launch mode, and who receives SIGTERM. The supervisor
itself is exercised with fake Xvfb and server processes, because child liveness
is behaviour a string check cannot prove.

Two things resist that treatment and are measured instead, because inferring
them from the Dockerfile was tried and kept producing checks that passed while
the build did something else.

Which backend builds the project is read off the wheel the builder stage
produces. Which paths reach the build context is asked of BuildKit through a
throwaway probe, since `.dockerignore` semantics survived no reimplementation
here without diverging quietly. Together they cost seconds against a warm
cache, and they skip locally without a daemon while failing in CI, because a
gate that skips itself is indistinguishable from one that passed.

What stays a string check is what a build cannot show: that verification was
not switched off, and that the constraint files still agree with each other.

    """Spelling the redirection out is what stops hiding a bad descriptor.

    The bare ``&`` this replaces gave every mode ``/dev/null`` whether it wanted
    one or not, so nothing here noticed what a launcher may actually pass.
    Handing it through unexamined is worse than either. A closed descriptor, a
    write-only one, one opened in Linux's fourth access mode and an ``O_PATH``
    handle all reach Python as ``EBADF`` on the first read, and an open
    directory ends the interpreter before argument parsing, taking down HTTP and
    the one-shot commands over an input none of them reads.

    The closed case does not arrive this way in the shipped image, because Tini
    refuses it first: it calls ``tcsetpgrp`` on descriptor 0 before executing
    anything and treats ``EBADF`` as fatal. This runs the script directly, which
    is how the case reaches the guard at all, and the guard keeps it for the
    overridden-entrypoint path.

    Asserting that the server merely started is not enough and was tried: with
    the descriptor passed through untouched it starts perfectly well, and only
    the first read says otherwise. Neither is the name it points at enough, and
    that was tried too: ``/dev/null`` opened for writing reads back as
    ``/dev/null``, so a fallback of ``0>/dev/null`` satisfied every case here
    while handing the server the same unreadable descriptor it was rescued
    from. The access mode is the part that cannot be faked.
