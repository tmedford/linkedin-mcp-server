"""Browser-DOM tests for reading which job search results are promoted.

The unit suite mocks ``page.evaluate``, so the program behind
``JobPageReader._extract_promoted_job_ids`` never runs there. These run it
against synthetic markup in headless chromium. The markup is a claim about the
algorithm, not about LinkedIn: a scrollable results rail beside a scrollable
detail pane, the shape the rail rule is written for, with cards built the two
ways a job id is carried.

Skipped automatically when chromium is not installed; run locally after
``uv run patchright install chromium --no-shell``.
