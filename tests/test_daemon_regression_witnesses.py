"""Negative controls for the daemon-only regressions the default-on contract names.

Each test here asserts the behaviour decided in
``docs/decisions/2026-09-26-daemon-default-on-contract.md``. A test still marked
``xfail`` fails against the current daemon, and that failure is the witness
release gate 1 asks for. The stage that fixes a regression removes its marker,
and the test stays as the guard.

Every one of them is source-model evidence. The real function runs, while the
operating system, the network and the owner are doubles, so nothing here is a
native measurement and none of it observes a signal reaching a wrong target.

The markers are strict and narrowed to ``AssertionError``: a passing body fails
the marked run as XPASS, and the fixing change removes the marker only after
validating the intended correction. This filter does not identify an
exception's origin. Setup and branch-reachability checks must fail normally,
and unrelated exceptions must not be accepted as intentional refusals.
