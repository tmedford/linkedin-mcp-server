"""Browser-DOM tests for the messaging sidebar programs.

The unit suite mocks ``page.evaluate``, so the three programs in
``linkedin/conversations.py`` never execute there: the click-to-capture loop,
the scrollable-region walk and the main-text wait are all asserted as call
arguments and nothing else. These cases run them in headless chromium.

The click loop is the reason this file exists. Selecting a conversation row
marks the thread read on LinkedIn, so the order of the name filter and the
click is the closest thing to a write anywhere in the linkedin package, and
that ordering lives entirely inside the JavaScript. A mocked ``evaluate``
cannot tell a loop that filters first from one that clicks first. The same
holds for thread ownership: whether a row is credited with the thread its own
click opened, or with one that was already open or that an earlier click
opened late, is decided entirely inside the loop.

Every fixture drives a synthetic container, so each case is a claim about the
algorithm rather than about LinkedIn's markup — with one deliberate exception
named in ``sidebar()``: the click target is selected by a class-name substring
that only LinkedIn's Ember output produces, and a fixture that did not
reproduce it would assert nothing about the selector.

    Each row carries an inner ``div`` whose class name contains
    ``listitem__link``, because that substring is the production selector: the
    Ember click handler sits on that div and neither the ``<li>`` nor the
    ``<label>`` triggers SPA navigation. A row appends its own id to ``#log``
    and then rewrites ``location`` through ``history.pushState``, which is how
    the real sidebar moves — the recorded order is what separates a loop that
    filters before it clicks from one that does not.

    The log is a DOM node rather than a global, because patchright evaluates
    in an isolated world: it shares the document with the page and shares no
    JavaScript globals with it, so a ``window`` property set by an inline
    handler reads back as ``undefined`` and every such assertion would pass
    vacuously.

    ``clickable=False`` drops every inner div, while ``unclickable`` can drop
    individual rows, standing in for a row LinkedIn rendered without a handler.
    ``routes=False`` keeps the handler and drops only the ``pushState``, standing
    in for a row whose click never reaches the thread route. Both are built here
    rather than patched in afterwards,
    because rewriting an ``onclick`` attribute from the isolated world leaves
    the page's own compiled handler in place and adds a second one: measured,
