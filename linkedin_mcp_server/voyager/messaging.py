"""Read the messaging inbox through LinkedIn's own Voyager GraphQL call.

Why this exists
---------------
``ConversationReader`` can only reach the conversations LinkedIn has painted
into the sidebar, and it harvests a thread id by *clicking* each row — which
marks it read. That makes a full inventory impossible: you cannot ask "have I
replied to everyone" without altering the thing you are measuring.

The web app itself does not work that way. It fetches conversations from
``voyagerMessagingGraphQL`` and renders the result, so every thread id is
already present in the payload as ``entityUrn``. Reading that same call gives
the whole mailbox, paged, with nothing clicked and nothing marked read.

Session handling is deliberately identical to the rest of the scraper: every
request is issued *inside the authenticated page* via ``page.evaluate``, so
cookies and CSRF come from the live session. No cookie file is read, no
credential is handled here, and there is no second auth path to keep in sync.

        Two things have to be true of the result and they pull in opposite
        directions.

        It must start at the FIRST page. The query that supports paging is the
        one the "load more" control issues, and that request already carries a
        cursor pointing past page one — returning it unchanged made every fresh
        walk silently skip the newest conversations. So the cursor is stripped
        here and put back only when a caller resumes.

        It must also work for a mailbox that fits on one page, where no "load
        more" control exists and no cursor-bearing request is ever emitted.
        Requiring one made the tool raise on a perfectly valid mailbox, so the
        page-load request is captured too.

        The second return value says WHICH of three things happened, because
        "no paging query" has two very different causes and conflating them is
        worse than the bug it replaced:

        - ``"cursored"``  — paging works.
        - ``"single-page"`` — the control was never present across every
          attempt, so the mailbox plausibly has one page.
        - ``"unconfirmed"`` — the control WAS found and clicked, yet no
          cursor-bearing request followed. Something went wrong; this must not
          be mistaken for a short mailbox.

        The queryId is a persisted hash that LinkedIn rotates, and the
        page-load query accepts only ``mailboxUrn`` while silently ignoring
        added cursor variables, so neither query can be synthesised or pinned.
