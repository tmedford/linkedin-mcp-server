        Works for both the compose-page sidebar and the URL-driven
        search-results sidebar (`/messaging/?searchTerm=…`), which share the
        same DOM shape: each conversation row is an ``<li>`` containing a
        ``<label>`` with an ``aria-label`` attribute carrying the participant
        name. The caller navigates first; the scan never chooses its page.

        LinkedIn renders the sidebar with no ``<a href>`` tags, no
        ``data-thread-id`` attributes, and no embedded URNs — clicking each
        row and reading the SPA URL is the only reliable extraction path.
        Pass ``limit=None`` to consider every visible row.

        A row is attributed a thread id only when, after its click, the
        pathname carries a thread id different from the one it carried
        immediately before that click. The first click that does not produce
        one stops the scan and no later row is clicked, because that click may
        still land and would then be credited to whichever row came next.

        When ``name_filter`` is provided, every row's aria-label is still read
        but only rows whose cleaned participant name equals it (case-insensitive)
        are clicked; non-matching rows are skipped without clicking. Clicking a
        row may mark it as read, so the filter keeps the read-marking side effect
        scoped to the requested participant when resolving by username.

        ``scroll_attempts`` bottom scrolls run after the rows attach and before
        they are read, with the same heuristic as the inbox text page.

        Scans the compose page's conversation list with click-to-capture
        because LinkedIn renders the messaging sidebar with no anchor hrefs, no
        data-thread attributes, and no embedded URNs — clicking each row and
        reading the resulting SPA URL is the only available extraction path.
        The compose page is the scan destination because, in the dated
        observation, it listed the inbox rows without opening a thread, while
        bare `/messaging/` opened one. It is not guaranteed never to open a
        thread; each row is still judged by its own click. The inbox list is
        used before `?searchTerm=` because LinkedIn's messaging search
        frequently returns "We didn't find anything" for a participant whose
        thread is plainly present in the inbox (issue #434). ``name_filter`` is
        passed to the enumerator so only matching rows are clicked; clicking a
        row may mark it read, so unrelated threads stay untouched.

        Matches by case-insensitive equality on the cleaned participant name
        derived from the row's aria-label, which tolerates duplicate threads
        with the same participant. Browser locale is forced to en-US so the
        verb prefix strips reliably; in any other locale the comparison fails
        cleanly with "Could not find a conversation" rather than returning
        a wrong-thread match.

        The search runs only when the inbox scan observed no matching row and
        hit no barrier, for instance when the rows never attached or the
        thread sits below the scrolled window. It never runs to extend or
        replace an inbox scan that stopped or has a gap, because a search
        result would then take the place of a position the inbox could not
        verify.

        Positions are those of the observed scan, which is not proven to order
        rows exactly as bare `/messaging/` does. Open a buried duplicate thread
        directly via ``thread_id`` (enumerate IDs with
