"""Repair the reference a caller passes in, before it becomes a URL.

Every tool argument that names a person, company, job or conversation ends up as
a path segment of a LinkedIn URL the browser then navigates to. Interpolating one
raw costs two things.

A pasted profile link never resolves. Handing a model a URL is the most natural
thing a user does, and ``https://www.linkedin.com/in/`` plus that URL is not a
page LinkedIn serves. The link arrives in more shapes than the canonical one: a
member's public profile URL carries the two-letter code of the country on their
profile (``de.``, ``ca.``, ``uk.``, ``fr.``, …) and those hosts answer directly
rather than redirecting to ``www.``, mobile adds ``m.``, ``touch.`` and the
``/mwlite/in/`` and ``/mwlite/profile/in/`` path wrappers, and a share sheet
appends ``?originalSubdomain=`` or ``?trk=``.

A value that resolves to a different path navigates somewhere else entirely.
Browsers apply RFC 3986 dot-segment removal before the request, so
``felix/../../feed`` reaches ``/feed/`` and the profile tool returns the feed as
if it were a profile. Percent-escaping the segment closes most of that, but not
all of it: ``quote`` leaves ``.`` untouched because a period is always URL-safe,
so a bare ``..`` still walks up a level. Both are refused here rather than
escaped, since neither can name anything.

Three rules earn their place by being easy to get wrong:

- **One decode, and no second layer.** A caller can hand over an already-escaped
  segment: ``get_my_profile`` reads the username straight out of ``page.url``
  after the ``/in/me/`` redirect, and a browser reports that path encoded.
  Passing it on unchanged would let the URL builder escape it again (``%D0``
  becomes ``%25D0``) and navigate to a path that is not the profile. So a value
  is decoded once. A result that still contains ``%`` is refused, because no
  identifier carries one and a second layer is how ``%252e%252e`` would survive
  into ``..`` on a later pass through this same function.
- **Malformed escapes are refused, never repaired.** ``unquote`` leaves ``%ZZ``
  untouched and turns ``%FF`` into a replacement character, so tolerating either
  silently changes the destination rather than rejecting the reference.
- **The reserved alias is refused in every form.** ``me`` is what LinkedIn
  resolves to the signed-in member, so accepting it from a caller that meant
  somebody else answers about the operator's own profile while reporting another
  person's.
