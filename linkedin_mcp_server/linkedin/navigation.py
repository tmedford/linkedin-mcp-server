        0.37ms at worst on an idle machine and 0.81ms with twenty-four workers

        ordinary failure with nothing behind it pays exactly that and no more.

        The listener overreports, so `_document_origin` decides which hop
        counts: a page rewriting its own address raises the same event and
        leaves nothing to settle.

        Where it stopped is answered by the hops falling quiet. Counting them
        rather than comparing addresses, or a chain that returns to the route
        it started on reads as one that never left.

        What the destination holds is answered by the document being ready. A
        replacement renders after it commits, and the account picker measured
        200ms behind its own navigation; judging that page on arrival calls a
