# The id is the trailing run of digits, and LinkedIn serves the same job under
# both `/jobs/view/1967281839/` and `/jobs/view/<title>-at-<company>-1967281839/`.
# Anchoring the digits to the front of the segment loses the slugged form
# entirely, and reads `2026` out of a title that opens with a year.
#
# The slug is anything but a separator, not `[\w-]`: JS `\w` is ASCII, and a
# localized title reaches this as `d%C3%A9veloppeur-web-at-koul-3510216552`,
# where the `%` ends the match and the id is lost. Measured on the guest
# search API for `developpeur`, where 6 of 10 hrefs were percent-encoded.
# The authenticated pages this server visits serve bare ids today (measured
# across job search, collections and a French search: 0 slugs in 27 anchors),
# so this branch is defensive on both counts.
# `scoped` runs the sidebar's own rule again and reads only the container it
# names, because everything outside it is not a search result: the detail pane
# holds its own permalink and, once opened, a similar-jobs module, and counting
# those as rendered results advances the offset past results the rail never
# showed. Re-run rather than remembered, so a rail replaced between the scroll
# and this call is followed instead of silently widening the scope back to the
# document. `get_saved_jobs` reads the document, having no sidebar to scroll
# and no second list to be confused with.

# jobs" cards, each linking its own posting, cannot match. It is an
# `<a href=".../jobs/view/<id>/apply/?openSDUIApplyFlow=true">` (measured on
# 2026-09-14).
#
# The external control is an `<a target="_blank">` into the off-site
# interstitial, which names the employer's page in its href (measured on
# 2026-09-19), so it is answered without a click. It and the state lines are
# read above the description heading only: below it sit the "More jobs" cards,
# each with an Apply of its own. Without the heading nothing is proven to be
# this posting's, and the read answers `unknown`.
#
# On 2026-09-14 the external control was a `<button>` with no href, whose click
# opened a "Share your profile?" dialog or a tab. LinkedIn counts that click as
# an apply on the posting, and no posting has shown the button since, so it is
# not read: a posting carrying it answers `unknown` and is never clicked.
#
# The heading is found by walking text nodes rather than asking every element
# for its text. Both find it; the walk visits fewer nodes and copies none of
# them, and `textContent` on every element of a posting copies that posting
# once per level of nesting. That is worth the difference because the readiness
# poll runs this program on every frame for up to ten seconds.
