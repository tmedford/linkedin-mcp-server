#: How much of the installer's output a failure message may quote. Patchright
#: embeds a whole non-200 response body in one error, and retries five times, so
#: an authenticated mirror answering with a page rather than a browser can emit
#: arbitrarily much. The tail is what says why it failed. Bounded by characters
#: as well as by count, because a fragment can itself be 64 KiB: two hundred of
#: those would put 12 MiB into an exception message and into ``last_error``.
_MAX_RETAINED_LINES = 200
_MAX_RETAINED_CHARS = 64 * 1024
#: Read size for the installer's pipe.
_READ_CHUNK = 64 * 1024
#: How much of a supervisor's startup diagnostics reaches its failure message.
#: Counted in characters and kept by ``_RedactedTail``, so the trim happens on
#: redacted text: on raw bytes it cut through whatever had arrived, and a cut
#: inside a long URL left a scheme-less remainder that no pattern here matches
#: and that ``BrowserSetupFailedError`` then carried to an MCP client.
_MAX_START_ERROR_CHARS = 8192
#: A run of output this long with no newline in it is emitted as one line rather
#: than buffered further. Bounds memory for output that never terminates a line.
_MAX_LINE_CHARS = 64 * 1024
#: Any userinfo in a URL, not only the ``user:password`` form. Patchright prints
#: the download URL it resolved, and ``PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST`` may
#: carry credentials for an internal mirror. A bare ``//TOKEN@host`` is as much
#: a secret as a pair, and so are ``//TOKEN:@host`` and ``//:TOKEN@host``, which
#: a pattern requiring both halves lets through. Greedy to the *last* ``@``: a
#: password may contain one, and stopping at the first leaves the rest of it in
#: the line. Backslashes too, which Node normalises to slashes before
#: authenticating, so ``https:\\user:pw@host`` is a working credential.
_CREDENTIALS_IN_URL = re.compile(r"[/\\]{2}[^/\\\s]*@")
#: Any absolute HTTP(S) URL, from its scheme to the first whitespace.
#: Everything the origin does not name is replaced, because nothing here can
#: tell a public build path from a capability.
#:
#: The configured mirror is not the only URL that reaches this output.
#: Patchright's download client follows redirects and interpolates the location
#: it *ended* on into its timeout and its error, so a mirror answering 302 with
#: ``https://cdn.example/another-bearer-token/chromium.zip`` puts a path
#: credential nobody configured into the debug log, into the retained failure
#: that becomes ``BrowserSetupFailedError``, and from there into whatever an MCP
#: client shows. Redacting the configured prefix cannot reach that URL, and no
#: parameter or path-segment list ever will either: ``?token=``, ``?api_key=``,
#: ``?X-Amz-Signature=`` and bare path tokens are all in use. So the whole URL
#: below the origin goes, and the part that says which mirror answered stays.
#:
#: Whitespace is the only boundary. An apostrophe used to end the run as well,
#: to protect the ``'. URL: `` that closes a response body, and it cost the rest
#: of every URL holding one: Node keeps an apostrophe in a path and in userinfo
#: alike, and a redirect to ``https://cdn.example/browser's.zip?X-Amz-Signature=
#: SECRET`` therefore printed everything from the quote onwards. What the closing
#: marker actually needs is held back in ``_held_back_closer`` instead, which is
#: two characters rather than the whole tail.
_URL_IN_TEXT = re.compile(r"(?i)\b(https?):[/\\]{2}(\S*)")
#: Where an authority ends. Backslashes are normalised to slashes first, as Node
#: does before resolving, so they are not in this class.
_AUTHORITY_ENDS = re.compile(r"[/?#]")
#: Where a redactable run opens. Both patterns above are represented, because a
#: cut is unsafe from whichever of them starts earlier: ``_URL_IN_TEXT`` needs
#: the scheme, so ``https:`` | ``//h/?token=SECRET`` leaves a remainder it
#: cannot see, and ``_CREDENTIALS_IN_URL`` needs the ``//``, so ``//us`` |
#: ``er:pw@h`` puts the ``@`` it matches on beyond the cut.
#:
#: The lookahead is the liveness test, and it is what keeps this off ordinary
#: text: a URL run ends at whitespace and a userinfo ends at the first slash as
#: well, so an opener with either of those between itself and the cut can no
#: longer reach across it, and the cut in front of it is free.

_CREDENTIAL_OPENS = re.compile(r"[/\\]{2}(?=[^/\\\s]*\Z)")

#: ending in ``h`` can be the first character of ``https://SECRET``, and a cut

#: yet for anything above to find. Every proper prefix of one is here, which
#: covers a cut inside a whole opener as the same case.
_OPENER_PENDING = re.compile(r"(?i)(?:\b(?:h|ht|htt|https?:?[/\\]?)|[/\\])\Z")

_WHITESPACE = re.compile(r"\s")
_NON_SPACE = re.compile(r"\S")
#: Where a run begins, scanned backwards for rather than matched. ``\S*\Z``
#: reads better and backtracks once per starting position, which is quadratic
#: on exactly the runs this exists for: measured at 9.9 seconds against 0.09
#: milliseconds on one 60 000-character token. Only the ASCII spaces are looked
#: for, so a rarer one merely widens the window; that costs a longer scan and
#: can hide nothing, because the searches above carry their own ``\S``.
_ASCII_SPACES = (" ", "\t", "\n", "\r")

#: body, and a body can carry the sequence that clears a terminal or renames
#: its window. rich strips these from what it renders; the debug log writes
#: straight to a stream and would not.

#: developer's terminal, so it is dropped rather than sanitised: it is where the
#: escape sequences, the reflected credentials, the markup and the absurd
#: numbers all came from, and none of it says anything the status code does not.
#: The body is not one line: ``content += chunk`` collects an HTML error page
#: with its newlines intact, so the closing marker can arrive thousands of lines
#: later.

    On POSIX the supervisor is its own session leader while the worker leads a

    signals the supervisor pid, the supervisor drains the worker group. A
    ``sitecustomize`` or ``usercustomize`` hook runs before
    :func:`installer_supervisor.main`, so anything it spawns lands in the
    supervisor's own group, where it inherits the installer output pipes and
    nothing ever reaps it. It would hold output EOF open after the supervisor
    exits and survive cancellation.

    ``-S`` is what closes that, and nothing weaker does. ``-P``,
    ``PYTHONNOUSERSITE`` and a popped ``PYTHONPATH`` never touch
    ``sitecustomize``, and ``-I`` only takes away the user-site copy: the one a
    virtual environment or a system install ships still runs. ``-I`` earns its
    place beside it because the file below re-adds an import root by hand, and
    an inherited ``PYTHONPATH`` would otherwise be searched in front of it.

    Because ``site`` is then gone, the module cannot be reached by name, so the
    file runs by absolute path from next to this one and re-adds that one root
    itself. ``-u`` matches :func:`windows_gate_command`, the other launcher that
    starts a stdlib-only helper this way, and keeps the framed stderr the parent
    parses independent of how the interpreter would buffer it. The worker keeps
    ordinary startup: its whole group is contained.

    Windows keeps the module form. There the supervisor runs under the gate
    inside the parent-owned kill-on-close Job, which already contains whatever
    a startup hook spawns, and the package import there probes the greenlet C
    runtime through modules that ``-S`` would put out of reach.

    Deliberately not ``async for line in stream``. That reads through
    ``readline``, which raises ``ValueError`` once a single line passes the
    reader's 64 KiB limit: mid-download, out of the loop, and with the child
    still running and unreaped. Patchright puts an entire non-200 response body
    into one error line, so a captive portal or a mirror answering with minified
    HTML reaches that limit, and the server would report an asyncio error
    instead of the download failure. Measured: a 70 000-byte line raises
    ``Separator is found, but chunk is longer than limit`` and leaves the child
    alive.

    Reads are staged rather than folded in one at a time. ``StreamReader.read``
    answers with whatever has arrived, which is a single byte as readily as a
    full chunk, and appending each one to a string and re-sanitising the result
    made the work quadratic in the length of the line: measured on this
    function, 2 000 bytes delivered one at a time scanned 2.0 million
    characters, 4 000 scanned 8.0 million and 8 000 scanned 32.0 million, so a
    64 KiB unterminated line would have scanned about 2.1 billion. Nothing is

    Unlike ``_start_login_if_needed()``, this ignores ``_auth_ready()`` — the
    caller has already proven the session is invalid despite profile files
    being present on disk.  The check-task → force-move → start-login sequence
    is atomic under ``_lock`` so an in-flight login is never corrupted.

    *stale_generation* is the login generation the caller found broken, which may
    be ``None`` when it found no session at all. Passing it is what keeps two
    clients from destroying each other's work: ``_lock`` is process-local, so it
    says nothing about the other process, and the rotation below is skipped when
    the generation on disk has moved on from the one being complained about.

    Left at :data:`UNGUARDED` only by a caller that has observed nothing, which
    is why the two are distinct values. Conflating them was measured to produce
    the worst available failure: a login that reports a window has opened, opens
    none, keeps the dead session and leaves readiness saying it is fine.
