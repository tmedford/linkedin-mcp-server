"""Refuse to open a profile with a browser older than the one that wrote it.

Chromium records its own version in ``<user-data-dir>/Last Version`` on every
run and treats a later launch by an older binary as a downgrade
(``downgrade_manager.cc``). It does not stop there on macOS or Linux -- it
carries on and lets each store decide for itself. That is the failure mode this
module exists to prevent: a store whose *compatible* version has been raised
past what the older binary accepts is rejected with ``INIT_TOO_NEW`` and the
browser simply runs without it. Cookies are such a store, so the visible symptom
is a session that was never invalid disappearing, followed by a login nobody
asked for.

Measured, and worth keeping because it explains why the check is stricter than
Chromium's own: bundled Chromium 148 opened a profile last written by Chrome 150
with cookies, Local Storage, IndexedDB and Cache Storage all intact, because
Chrome 150 marks its Web Data schema as compatible back that far. It also
*rewrote* the version markers on the way out. So the compatibility is real, and
it is a snapshot -- it holds until one store raises its floor, and nothing warns
when that happens.

Every answer here fails open. Being unable to read a marker, name the binary or
parse a version is not evidence of a downgrade, and refusing to start a browser
on the strength of a missing file would turn a guard into an outage.

That choice costs more than it looks like it does, and the cost belongs here
rather than in a reviewer's head. Failing open once is not "we will catch it
next time": the older browser runs, and on its way out it rewrites `Last
Version` down to its own number (measured -- a launch on a profile marked
`1.0.0.0` left it reading `148.0.7778.96`). The evidence is gone, so every later
launch sees no downgrade even after whatever made the version unreadable is
fixed. It is still the right trade, because the alternative refuses working
setups on the strength of not knowing, but the guard is one-shot per profile
and nothing downstream can recover it.

#: Written by Chromium itself, directly inside the profile directory, with a
#: space in the name and no extension. Not one of ours, so it is never created
#: or removed here -- only read.
LAST_VERSION_FILE = "Last Version"

#: A binary that will not answer ``--version`` must not hold up the launch.
#: Generous rather than tight: the measured cost is ~35 ms warm, and the only
#: thing a low bound would buy is a false "unknown" on a loaded machine.
_VERSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 15.0

#: Three components at minimum, so a two-part build suffix ("built on Debian
#: 10.9") cannot be mistaken for a version. Real values have four:
#: ``148.0.7778.96``.
#:
#: Anchored to whitespace or the start of the line, which is the part that stops
#: the guard failing *closed*. A `CHROME_PATH` launcher script announcing itself
#: as `Chromium launcher v1.2.3` before it execs a browser would otherwise be
#: read as version `1.2.3` of a product called `Chromium launcher v` -- older
#: than every profile, and named plausibly enough to be compared. The user is
#: then told to run a newer browser, which is exactly what they were doing.
#: A version glued to a preceding word is not a version, so it is not one here.
_VERSION = re.compile(r"(?:^|(?<=\s))\d+(?:\.\d+){2,}")

#: Product names whose version numbers track Chromium milestones, and which are
#: therefore comparable against a `Last Version` that carries no product of its
#: own.
#:
#: Matched whole, not as a prefix, and that is the second half of the wrapper
#: defence rather than a stylistic choice. A `CHROME_PATH` launcher announcing
#: itself as `Chromium launcher 1.2.3` parses cleanly -- the version is
#: space-separated and the name starts with a word we know -- so a prefix scan
#: accepted it, compared `1.2.3` against the profile, and refused a browser
#: that was in fact newer. Measured. A name we have not seen costs the guard;
#: a name we half-recognise cost a launch nobody could recover.
#:
#: Chromium forks number themselves their own way: Vivaldi is on 7.x, and Edge
#: puts a build number an order of magnitude below Chrome's under the same
#: major. Pointing `CHROME_PATH` at either, against a profile the bundled
#: browser wrote, reads as a downgrade of hundreds of versions. It is not one,
#: and the message it would produce asks for something no build of that
#: browser will ever satisfy.
#:
#: This identifies the *running* binary, which is all `--version` can tell us,
#: and that bounds the rule: a profile written by a fork and then opened by the
#: bundled browser is still refused, because `Last Version` names no product.
#: That case is not repairable from here. Mixing two products over one profile
#: directory is outside what this server supports, and the error says to run
#: whichever browser produced that number again, which is the way out.
#:
#: An unrecognised name costs the guard, never a false refusal, which is the
#: right direction to be wrong in.
#:
#: **Both managed names are needed, because the supported range spans both.**
#: The two binaries name themselves differently, and which one a user runs
#: depends on the patchright they resolved and on their platform. From the
#: driver's own `DOWNLOAD_PATHS`:
#:
#: * at the lock (patchright 1.63.0, revision 1243) every target, Linux arm64
#:   included, is `cftUrl(...)`, which unpacks to `chrome-linux64/`,
#:   `chrome-linux-arm64/` or `Google Chrome for Testing.app` and reports
#:   `Google Chrome for Testing`
#: * through patchright 1.61.2, every supported `ubuntu*-arm64` and
#:   `debian*-arm64` was `chromium-linux-arm64.zip`, which unpacks to
#:   `chrome-linux/` and reports `Chromium`
#: * at the declared floor (patchright 1.55.0) every platform reports
#:   `Chromium`
#:
#: (`void 0` entries in that table name platforms patchright will not install
#: on at all; at the lock that includes `ubuntu20.04-*`, so they name nothing.)
#:
#: `uvx` and `pip` resolve the declared range fresh, so both names are in the
#: field on any given release even though the published images now agree.
#: Dropping either entry as redundant would silently turn the guard off for a
#: supported install, which is the mistake this paragraph exists to prevent.
#:
#: The version history behind those bullets.
#: Revision 1200 (patchright 1.57.0) moved macOS *and* Linux x64 to Chrome for
#: Testing together; only Linux arm64 stayed on Playwright's own build, and
#: that split lasted through patchright 1.61.2. Read it off `EXECUTABLE_PATHS`
#: rather than the download table: at 1.57.0 `linux-x64` is
#: `["chrome-linux64", "chrome"]` while `linux-arm64` is still
#: `["chrome-linux", "chrome"]`, carrying the driver's own `// non-cft build`
#: comment. At 1.63.0 `linux-arm64` is `["chrome-linux-arm64", "chrome"]` and
#: the comment is gone.
#:
#: Two separate events are easy to conflate here, and conflating them is how
#: the first version of this paragraph got the story wrong: *what* is packaged
#: changed at revision 1200, while *where it is fetched from* changed at
#: patchright 1.58.0, when `cftUrl(...)` first appears. That second move is not
#: a move to Google: `cftUrl` points at Playwright's own CDN in both eras,
#: `cdn.playwright.dev/chrome-for-testing-public/<version>/...` at 1.58.0 and
#: `cdn.playwright.dev/builds/cft/<version>/...` from 1.61.2 on. Nothing here ever
#: fetches from `storage.googleapis.com`.
#:
#: For anyone allowlisting egress, one host is not the whole answer. Every
#: plain `builds/...` entry goes through `PLAYWRIGHT_CDN_MIRRORS`, three hosts
#: tried in order: `cdn.playwright.dev/dbazure/download/playwright`,
#: `playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com/dbazure/download/playwright`, then
#: `cdn.playwright.dev`. At the lock that is ffmpeg on *every* platform, since
#: `patchright install chromium` resolves that too and its entries are plain
#: templates; through 1.61.2 it was the arm64 image's browser as well. The
#: `cftUrl` entries, every browser at the lock, are the other shape:
#: one host, `cdn.playwright.dev`, and no fallback at all. Allowing only
#: `cdn.playwright.dev` therefore installs everything, because two of the three
#: mirrors are on it; what is lost is the Microsoft-hosted fallback, so the gap
#: shows up only when the primary CDN is degraded.
#:
#: At the floor every target still reads from `builds/chromium/`, which says
#: nothing about which browser is inside. Binaries run directly: revision
#: 1194 ->
#: `Chromium 141.0.7390.37`, revision 1200 -> `Google Chrome for Testing
#: 143.0.7499.4`, and revisions 1217, 1223, 1228 and 1243 -> `Google Chrome for
#: Testing`, all on macOS arm64. On Linux arm64 the container reported
#: `Chromium 148.0.7778.0` at revision 1223 -- the same revision that reports
#: `Google Chrome for Testing 148.0.7778.96` on macOS. One revision, two names,
#: decided by the platform: that pair is the clearest statement of the rule.
#:
#: The other platforms, measured under Docker rather than reasoned about, since
#: reasoning is what got this paragraph wrong the first time. At the floor
#: (revision 1187) linux-x64 and linux-arm64 both report `Chromium
#: 140.0.7339.16`, exactly as macOS does -- so at the floor there is no
#: platform split at all. At revision 1228 (patchright 1.61.2) linux-x64
#: reports `Google Chrome for Testing 149.0.7827.55` while linux-arm64 reports
#: `Chromium 149.0.7827.0`, note the differing final component. At the lock
#: (revision 1243) both images report `Google Chrome for Testing
#: 153.0.8010.12`, and so does macOS arm64. Windows never answers:
#: :func:`a_version_can_be_asked_for` refuses before any binary is asked.
#:
#: The third entry is not a managed browser at all. `Google Chrome
#: 150.0.7871.189` is what an operator's own binary reports when `CHROME_PATH`
#: points at real Chrome.
#:
#: Note carefully which direction needs it, because the obvious one does not.
#: :func:`is_comparable` is only ever asked about the *running* binary, never
#: about whatever wrote the profile -- `Last Version` records no product to ask
#: about. So the familiar case, a Chrome-written profile opened by the bundled
#: browser, is carried by the two managed names and would still be refused with
#: this entry gone. What needs it is the reverse: `CHROME_PATH` at a real
#: Chrome that is itself the older binary, against a profile a newer Chrome or
#: the bundled Chrome for Testing already wrote. Drop the entry and that launch
#: stops being checked at all, silently.
#:
#: Do not infer any of this from `browsers.json`. Its `title` key did not exist
#: before patchright 1.58.0, and where it does exist it reads `Chrome for
#: Testing` without the `Google` the binary prints. It says which family a
#: build belongs to and nothing about the string matched here.
#:
#: Distribution and snap builds put the build host after the number, and the
#: beta and dev channels put the channel there, so all of those still read as
#: `Chromium` or `Google Chrome`.
#:
#: One entry nobody here could measure: Chrome Canary. If it names itself
#: `Google Chrome Canary` rather than putting the channel after the version,
#: the guard is simply off for that install, which is the direction this errs
#: in anyway. Recorded rather than guessed at.

    False on Windows, and not because the answer would merely be empty.
    Chromium handles ``--version`` in ``HandleVersionSwitches``, and both that

    ``#if BUILDFLAG(IS_POSIX) && !defined(BUILDING_CHROME_RENDERER)``

    Windows that code is not compiled, so ``--version`` is not a handled switch
    but an *unrecognised* one, and an unrecognised switch does not stop a
    browser from starting.

    What the probe would actually do there: no ``--user-data-dir`` is passed,
    so it opens whatever profile that binary defaults to, which with
    ``CHROME_PATH`` set is the user's own Chrome. If a browser is already
    running on it, the new process forwards its command line and exits, leaving
    a window open and no output. If none is, the probe *is* the browser: it
    never exits, blocks the launch for the full timeout, and is then killed,
    which is what makes Chrome offer to restore pages on the user's next start.

    So the guard is off on Windows, deliberately and quietly. There is no half
    measure available: a version could only come from the executable's own
    file-version resource, which is separate work.
