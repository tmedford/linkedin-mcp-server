"""Getting an owner started, from the side of the process that wants one.

The counterpart to :mod:`linkedin_mcp_server.daemon`, which only reads. This is
where a process acts: it starts a detached owner and waits for the endpoint to
exist. It never becomes the owner itself, because it cannot: ``cli_main`` runs
the stdio server blocking, so a process that served the owner's HTTP could not
also serve its own client.

The child owns every operation that may mutate daemon state. It opens the log,
takes the lock, starts the endpoint, and publishes while holding that lock. This
subprocess boundary is also the frontend's timeout boundary: if state storage is
stuck in the kernel, the parent can kill the child and prove that no abandoned
worker can later acquire the lock or publish over an in-process fallback. A
thread cannot provide that proof because it cannot be killed.
