        and driver are still live: no Patchright teardown, no OS-level drain,
        and a caller free to release or delete the profile with Chromium on it.

        A teardown that was never proved is refused rather than reset. That is
        the whole meaning of ``_close_interrupted``: the earlier browser may
        still be sitting on this profile, and opening a second one there is the
        concurrent-profile corruption this module exists to prevent. No state
        cleared here can make the first browser gone, so the only safe answer

        What crosses the boundary and what does not:

        * The marker is minted fresh. The old one was handed to
          ``forget_browser_process_marker`` on the strength of the proof, so a
          second Chromium carrying it would announce itself under a launch this
          process has already written off. A new one also re-registers with the
          crash guardian, which is exactly what a new manager would do.
        * The containment is dropped. A proved Windows drain empties the Job
          and closes its handle (``WindowsJob.wait_until_empty``), so what is
          left is spent, and this attribute is documented as describing *this*
          launch.
        * ``_is_authenticated`` goes back to false. It says startup
          authentication succeeded for the page this manager hands out, and
          ``drivers.browser.validate_session`` skips its live check while it is
          true. Carried over, it would answer for a context nobody validated.
        * ``_no_window_available`` deliberately survives. It records that this
          machine refused a window, which a second launch on the same machine
          would only rediscover by opening another doomed headed browser.
