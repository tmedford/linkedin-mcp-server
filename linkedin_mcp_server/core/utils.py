# Both card shapes. The classic result is an anchor to the job permalink;
# the redesigned search at `/jobs/search-results` renders cards that carry no
# permalink at all and keep the id only in `componentkey`. A selector matching
# just the anchor finds nothing there, which is what made the search return an
# empty `job_ids` while its text listed real jobs.

# The rule that decides which container holds the search results. Shared
# verbatim by the scroll and by id extraction, because extraction re-runs it
# rather than trusting a mark the scroll left behind: an attribute dies with
# the node it sits on, a re-render between the scroll returning and the ids
# being read leaves none, and nothing then distinguishes that from a page
# nobody scrolled. Everything outside the rail is not a search result: the
# detail pane carries its own permalink and, once opened, a similar-jobs
# module, and counting those advances the offset past results the rail never
# showed. Expects `selector` in scope.

# reads as a batch, which spends one of `maxScrolls` and can end the page with
# the batch still in flight. Only the node itself identifies it. Its position
# does not: wrapping the rail, or inserting a tied sibling before it, puts
# another container where the rail was. A rail a re-render detached is
# replaced by a fresh pick, which is what adopting a replacement always did.

    LinkedIn renders job search results in a scrollable sidebar container,
    not the main page body. Finding it means looking at every scrollable
    ancestor of every card: the job detail pane scrolls on its own, and a
    card may sit in a scrollable wrapper of its own. The rail is the
    candidate holding the most distinct job ids, so the pane's "similar
    jobs" module is not pulled into the page. Measured on a live search:
    the rail held 7 ids before scrolling and 11 after, the pane held 1
    throughout. Candidates tied with the pick are scrolled alongside it when
    one contains the other, because only the inner one appends cards. Tied
    siblings are not: those two are the rail and the pane, and scrolling the
    pane is what loads the similar-jobs module.

    There is no target count. How many cards a page yields belongs to
    LinkedIn, and assuming a number is what this function used to get wrong
    in the other direction. It stops when the rail stops growing, and
    ``search_jobs`` pages by what actually loaded.

    Each scroll waits for the next batch by polling instead of sleeping a
    fixed amount, because how long a batch takes belongs to the user's
    connection. A round that sees nothing waits once more at the full
    ``settle_timeout`` before the rail counts as exhausted: deciding that
    after a single fixed 0.5s look is what cost a measured search 4 of its
    11 cards. It is the wait that buys those cards and not the second
    scroll, which lands on a rail already at ``scrollHeight`` and fires no
    event; it is kept for the case where the rail moved during the first
    wait. A round therefore waits at most ``2 * settle_timeout``. Later
    rounds start from three times what the previous batch took, floored at
    ``min_budget``, which shortens the terminating round on a fast link.

    Returns whether a step on the page raised, which the caller needs and
    cannot see for itself. A navigation destroys the execution context and
    the step raises, and ``page.url`` still reports the address it left for
    about 6ms after that, measured over ten runs at 6ms min and max alike, so
    a caller sampling the URL right here compares two copies of the old one.
    Awaiting the load state does not close that window: the previous document
    is loaded already, so it returns at once.

    DOM dependency: scrolling requires an element reference, which innerText
    extraction cannot provide.

    Args:
        page: Patchright page object
        settle_timeout: Longest wait for one batch; a round may use it twice
        poll_interval: How often to look for the batch (seconds)
        min_budget: Smallest wait a fast connection may shrink to (seconds)
        max_scrolls: Backstop on scroll attempts; ``deadline`` is the real bound
        deadline: Wall-clock bound for the whole call, the wait for the
            first card included (seconds). That wait is separately capped at
            5s, so a longer deadline buys scrolling and not patience: a search
            page still holding no card after 5s is throttled or empty, and
