"""Tell local storage apart from storage something else also writes to.

The shared-browser daemon coordinates through a lock, a descriptor and a token
file that several processes on one machine must agree on. A network filesystem
does not promise those semantics, and a sync client copies, replaces and
restores files behind the processes that own them. Either can hand a stale
descriptor or a second lock to a process that then drives the same profile, so
only storage this module can show to be local qualifies. Everything else keeps
the Direct server it had before the daemon existed.

The policy is in ``docs/decisions/2026-09-26-daemon-default-on-contract.md``:
local filesystem types are allow-listed, known sync providers are refused, and
what cannot be classified is refused too. Sync that leaves no trace this module
can read, such as Syncthing or rsync, is a documented limitation. So is iCloud's
"Desktop & Documents" on macOS: those folders stay where they are, and asking
iCloud Drive which folders it mirrors would itself raise a privacy prompt.

The one entry point, :func:`classify`, never raises. A failure anywhere inside
is an answer, ``UNKNOWN``, because the caller's only safe reaction to "could
not tell" is the same as to "not local".
