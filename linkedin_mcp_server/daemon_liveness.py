"""Whether anybody is still waiting for a call the owner is running.

A frontend that gives up does not take its call with it. Cancellation is not
forwarded across the loopback hop: measured in this repository, the client was
answered at 0.66s with an error and the effect landed 0.7s later, against a
LinkedIn account nobody was watching any more. The owner has no way to notice,
because a call it is already running looks exactly like one somebody wants.

So the frontend says so, repeatedly, for as long as it is still waiting, and the
owner cancels what nobody is waiting for. Kept in its own module rather than in
``daemon_owner`` or ``server`` because both ends need the same names and those
two must not import each other.

**Every call is marked, or it does not run.** A call the owner cannot identify
is a call it cannot cancel, so the owner refuses one that arrives without a
marker, and the frontend never forwards a call whose heartbeat preflight failed.
That is tool protocol 2 (``daemon_descriptor.PROTOCOL_VERSION``). Protocol 1
made both halves optional so a mixed pair could share tools; the default-on
contract drops that pairing, and a mismatched owner is now only ever asked to
stand down.

**Admission and retirement are one decision.** Whether this owner takes another
call and whether it may go away are both answered here, on one tracker and with
no ``await`` between checking and setting. On one event loop that makes the two
orderings the only ones possible: the call wins and retirement sees it, or
retirement wins and the call is refused before anything below it runs.
