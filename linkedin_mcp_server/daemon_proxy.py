"""Talking to the owner, from the frontend that forwards to it.

The other half of :mod:`linkedin_mcp_server.daemon_election`: that module gets an
owner running and hands back an attachment, and this one turns the attachment into
something a FastMCP server can serve tools from.

Kept out of ``server.py`` deliberately. That module answers which parts of a
server a role gets; the loopback address, the bearer token, the proxy-environment
refusal and the forwarding deadline are all daemon knowledge, and every one of
them is a way to leak a credential or to hang a call.

No client *session* is cached: one is built per upstream operation, because that
is how ``ProxyProvider`` uses its factory and because a single shared session
would outlive the owner it was opened against. The address and token are read
per operation too, from :class:`DaemonProxyBackend`, so a proxy follows a
replacement owner instead of keeping an address it captured at startup.

**Which owner that is changes while this process runs**, and the rest of this
module is about surviving it. ``@latest`` is the documented install, so the first
client to launch after an upgrade stands the old owner down, and every proxy
already attached to it would otherwise be dead until its own process restarts.
Reproduced end to end before any of this existed: a proxy serving 19 tools was
asked nothing, its owner was told to stand down the way a newer build does
(``daemon_election._ask_to_stand_down``), and the next listing failed with
``McpError: Client failed to connect``. Idle exit and a crashed owner end the
same way.

Noticing the departure is one half; repeating the call is the other, and it is
the half that can do damage. There is no dispatch acknowledgement anywhere in the
protocol, so a failure is classified where the boundary is known
(:class:`OwnerUnreachableError`) rather than diagnosed from a message afterwards.
Only a request that provably never left this process may be repeated when running
it twice would send a connection request twice.

    An ``MCPError`` looks like an answer and usually is one: a JSON-RPC error
    came off the wire, so a process was there to send it. Treating those as a
    departure would elect a replacement for a healthy owner, repeat a read-only
    call for nothing, and swallow ``ProxyProvider``'s own ``METHOD_NOT_FOUND``
    handling, which turns an unsupported listing into an empty list.

    Some are not answers, and they matter more than all the real ones put
    together, because they are what a departure *during* a request looks like.
    The client invents each of them itself:

    * ``REQUEST_TIMEOUT`` (``-32001``) when nothing came back inside the
      deadline (``mcp/shared/jsonrpc_dispatcher.py:425``). SDK v1 used the HTTP
      status 408 here, and v2 no longer does (SDK ``docs/migration.md:1933``).
    * ``CONNECTION_CLOSED`` when the read stream closes with requests still
      pending (same file, 400 and 693), and when an SSE response ends without
      one (``mcp/client/streamable_http.py:502-509``, reached from 498 and 532).
    * the HTTP stand-ins in :data:`_SYNTHETIC_ERRORS` and
      :data:`_SYNTHETIC_ERROR_PREFIXES`. SDK v2 turns a failed HTTP exchange
      into an error for that one request instead of failing the transport
      (SDK ``docs/migration.md:2178``), and writes one of these whenever the
      response carried no JSON-RPC error of its own.

    Measured under SDK v1 against a real loopback owner killed while a call was
    in flight: a timeout error nobody sent. Passing it through as an answer
    would leave the frontend attached to a process that is gone, which is the
    failure this module exists to end.

    **The first two are read by code alone and the rest by code and message.**
    Code alone for the two the SDK reserves for itself, so a reworded message
    in a future SDK cannot silently stop a real departure from being
    recognised. Code and message for the rest, because each of their codes is
    an ordinary answer too. Neither is a guarantee the protocol makes: the SDK
    forwards a real JSON-RPC error body verbatim, so a server that sends
    exactly one of these pairs cannot be told from the stand-in, and it is
    taken for one. That is the cautious direction. It costs an election that
    finds the same owner still answering, and at worst an ``outcome_unknown``
    where a plainer error was possible. The owner is this same package and
    raises no ``MCPError`` of its own: a failing tool comes back as a result
    with ``is_error`` set.

    Nothing here says whether the tool request left this process, and nothing
    may read it that way. That is ``nothing_was_sent``, answered by the
    boundary and the session's own record, and an error the
    client invented after the request went out leaves it false: a call that
    could change something is then reported as an unknown outcome and never
    repeated.

    A departure has three shapes, all measured with the client the provider
    builds, and only the third reaches this question:

    * already gone when the client connects: ``RuntimeError`` over
      ``httpx2.ConnectError``, out of ``__aenter__``.
    * gone after the initialize and before the request that follows it, which is
      a real window because one operation opens a client, initializes it and then
      sends its request on that same session: ``anyio.BrokenResourceError`` or
      ``ClosedResourceError``, depending on timing.
    * gone while the request is outstanding: one of the invented errors above.

    The first two are not ``MCPError`` and are tagged without consulting any of
    this. Under SDK v2 the second can reach it too: with a transport that
    refused the connection for one later request of an open session, that
    request came back as ``CONNECTION_CLOSED``, which is still not an answer.

            The one boundary that runs *after* an answer exists, and the reason
            it needs guarding at all is that the answer is already on its way
            out. ``ProxyTool.run`` makes its call inside ``async with client``
            and all four provider listings do the same (``proxy.py``, ``run``
            and ``_list_tools`` with its siblings), while ``Client._disconnect``
            awaits the session task under
            ``suppress(asyncio.CancelledError)`` (``client.py``). Only
            cancellation is suppressed, so an ordinary exception from that task
            leaves this context manager and replaces whatever the operation had
            decided.

            Both directions are damage, measured through the real stack. With a
            tagged ``OwnerUnreachableError`` in flight, the replacement reaches
            the middleware carrying the tag in ``__context__`` only, which
            ``unreachable_owner_in`` does not walk and must not start walking:
            Python sets ``__context__`` on *any* exception raised while another
            is being handled, and this middleware raises its repeat inside the
            ``except`` that holds the first failure, so every unrelated failure
            of a repeat would resolve to the owner loss before it — absorbed by
            today's branches, which read that first failure's own
            ``nothing_was_sent``, and one edit away from not being. The
            middleware therefore re-raises at its ``failure is None`` branch and
            masking flattens that to ``Error calling tool
            'send_connection_request'`` — nothing about a call that may have
            acted. With nothing in flight it is the *result* that is replaced,
            and the owner had already run the tool: the same generic failure for
            a call that did send the connection request, and this half carries no
            tag anywhere, so no detector could have found it.

            Swallowing adds no leak of its own here, which is a narrower claim
            than a promise about every way cleanup can fail. A client here is
            built for one operation and dropped (``open_client``), and
            ``_disconnect`` drops the session task in its own ``finally`` —
            cancelling it first if it is still running — before this is reached,
            so what arrives is the report of a failure and not a resource still
            held; what a future ``_disconnect`` might leave behind when *it*
            fails is its own to answer for. The operation succeeded or it
            failed, and a departure this one misses is found by the next
            operation, which opens a client of its own.
            Cancellation is not caught, because ``CancelledError`` is a
            ``BaseException`` and a caller giving up is not the session's own
            failure.

            One falsy return says both things. Python consults it only while an
            exception is in flight, where falsy means "do not suppress" and the
            tagged failure goes on propagating; with nothing in flight it is
            ignored and the result stands.

        *classification* is why the failed owner failed. One that buries it is
        recorded before anything else happens (:meth:`note_failure`).

        **The identity check comes first, and it is what keeps a late failure
        cheap.** Several calls can be in flight against one owner. The first to
        fail elects a replacement; the others fail afterwards still carrying the
        old identity, and without this they would each elect again, against an
        owner that is already answering.

        **The latest burial wins over an election already running.** A caller
        that joins a flight started before it buried an owner cannot trust that
        flight's answer, because the election ran without knowing: a retiring
        owner still answers its probe. An answer naming a written-off owner is
        refused, and if the flight did not know everything this caller knows,
        one more flight is run with it. At most two per call here, so a
        recovery cannot spin.

        **The election runs in a thread, and that is correctness rather than
        latency.** ``obtain_owner`` probes liveness through ``asyncio.run``, which
        raises inside a running loop, and its own ``except`` turns that into
        ``Reach.REFUSED``. Called in-loop it would therefore bury a *healthy*
        owner for the whole election rather than merely blocking.

        **Shielded, and this one is measured.** Cancelling the task that awaits
        ``asyncio.to_thread`` returns to the awaiter at once while the worker runs
        to completion regardless: driven directly, an awaiter cancelled at 0.1s
        and a worker that still finished its 1.5s of work. So a caller that gives
        up must not clear this guard, or the next failure starts a second election
        while the first is still running.

    liveness wrapper, rather than one wrapper around both.

    Discovery is covered as well as calling, and it is the half a client hits
    first: many list before they call. A recovery that only covered
    ``tools/call`` would leave a client whose owner died unable to list, and
    therefore unable to make the call that would have triggered the recovery:
    dead in exactly the way this exists to prevent.

    All four listings, not only tools, although this role serves nothing but
    tools. A client's opening exchange asks for resources and prompts too, the
    provider is asked in order to answer "none", and with
    ``provider_error_strategy = "raise"`` a departed owner turns that answer into
    an error the user sees.

    Reads and renders are left out, and the reason is a fact about this
    repository rather than about the protocol: no owner here registers a resource
    or a prompt, so the listings in front of them find nothing and a client
    cannot reach ``resources/read`` or ``prompts/get`` at all. The day one is
    registered, ``read_resource_mcp`` and ``get_prompt_mcp`` need the same
    treatment as the listings, along with ``on_read_resource`` and
    ``on_get_prompt`` here.

    **What one tool call can cost, counted.** This middleware makes at most two
    attempts per invocation. Each attempt is one
    heartbeat preflight and at most one dispatch; only the first attempt's
    failure recovers, joining at most :data:`_ELECTIONS_PER_RECOVERY`
    elections, and the second's is recorded without electing. The auth-repair
    middleware outside invokes this at most twice per client call, once and one
    read-only replay. So one client call is at most four preflights, four

        process does not.

        A result rather than a raise, and what decides that is the payload rather
        than the masking. Two raises have to be told apart, both measured against
        fastmcp 3.4.7 with the masking this server switches on (``server.py``,
        ``mask_error_details=True``). Re-raising the failure that arrived says
        nothing: ``OwnerUnreachableError`` is a plain ``Exception``, so the call

        'send_message'")`` (``fastmcp/server/server.py:1342-1358``), and that is
        the whole of what the client gets on the one call that most needs to
        hear a retry can deliver the message twice. A ``ToolError`` raised
        *here* keeps its own text: the masking sits below this middleware, and
        even there a ``FastMCPError`` — which ``ToolError`` is — is re-raised
        untouched (``:1327-1331``). What neither raise carries is ``status`` and
        ``retry_safe``, the two fields a client can act on without reading
        prose, and they are why this answer is a result.

        ``is_error`` stays true so a client that reads no structured content
        still sees a failure rather than a success carrying no data, the way
        ``daemon_auth`` answers a sign-in.

        Keeping it true is also what lets this payload ignore the tool's declared
        output schema: an error result travels as a whole ``CallToolResult``,
        which ``mcp.server.lowlevel.server`` returns unchanged instead of
        validating it. A success-shaped dict would be checked against the schema
