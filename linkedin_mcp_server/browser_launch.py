# WebRTC reaches the network over UDP, which an HTTP proxy does not carry. It
# therefore goes around the proxy and hands the page the machine's real
# address. Measured against a real STUN server: a page saw the proxy's address
# in the HTTP request and the real IPv4 *and* IPv6 in the ICE candidates at the
# same time, which is trivially correlated and leaves the proxy pointless.
#
# Both spellings are passed because each binary reads a different one. Full
# Chrome and Chromium take the plain switch through the command-line pref
# store (`chrome_command_line_pref_store.cc`), and modern `--headless` shares
# that path; the separate `chrome-headless-shell` reads only the `--force-`
# variant, in `headless/lib/browser/headless_web_contents_impl.cc`. Full Chrome
# has no consumer for `--force-` at all. Chromium has no central switch
# registry, so a switch no consumer asks for is simply inert, and the two
# values are identical, so no binary can end up with a conflicting policy.
#
# Verified on all four rungs — real Chrome headed and headless, bundled full
# Chromium, and the headless shell: every baseline produced a server-reflexive
# candidate and every fixed run produced none.
#
# Note this does more than hide the address. With no proxied UDP available, no
# ICE candidate forms at all, so WebRTC stops working rather than lying about
# where it is. That is acceptable here because nothing in this server uses it:
# there is no RTCPeerConnection and no getUserMedia anywhere in the codebase.

#: Headed Chromium under the image's Xvfb display starts with WebGL disabled,
#: despite Mesa's software rasteriser being present. Measured on both published
#: architectures: every one of ten cold launches per architecture produced no
#: WebGL1 or WebGL2 context without these two switches, and 10/10 of each with
#: them. The unmasked renderer was byte-identical across all twenty:
#: ``ANGLE (Mesa/X.org, llvmpipe (LLVM 15.0.6 128 bits), OpenGL 4.5)``.
#:
#: These do not select a renderer; Mesa/llvmpipe is what the image provides.
#: Every explicit selector tried instead (ANGLE GL, EGL, desktop GL, Vulkan)
#: produced no context. SwiftShader worked, and stays excluded: Patchright
#: strips its unsafe fallback deliberately because that renderer string is an
#: automation signal in its own right.
