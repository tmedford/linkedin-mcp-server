"""Discovery -> rank -> extract -> validate -> persist for browser import.

This module is imported lazily (see ``__init__``) because it pulls in
``drivers.browser`` for the validation step.

Selection is a three-tier test, cheapest first, so the macOS keychain is only
touched for the browser we actually import from:

1. Keychain-free pre-filter: a profile is a *live* candidate only if it has an
   ``li_at`` cookie whose ``expires`` is in the future. Reads the plaintext
   SQLite columns, no value decryption, no keychain prompt. Drops browsers with
   no LinkedIn login and expired/logged-out sessions.
2. Recency ranking (also keychain-free): live candidates are ordered by
   ``li_at.last_access`` descending, so the browser the user most recently used
   LinkedIn in is tried first.
3. Authoritative confirm: in that order, decrypt the one profile (keychain
   prompt for that browser only), inject the cookies into the source profile,
   and prove ``/feed/``. The first that passes is imported; a profile whose
   cookie is present but server-rejected falls through to the next.
