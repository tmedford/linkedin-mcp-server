"""The lock that decides which process owns the shared browser.

Held for a process lifetime rather than around an operation, which is what
separates it from the profile lease next door. That difference is not
cosmetic. The lease is reference counted so a tool call, the browser singleton
and a destructive helper can each hold it at once, and it is released the moment
the browser closes so ``--login`` can take it. A lock with those properties
cannot decide ownership: it would be free every time the browser happened to be
shut, and holding it for a whole process life would lock out every login.

So this is a separate file with the same kernel primitives and different rules:
one holder, no reference counting, released only on exit.

Two things it must never do, both of which cost the lock silently:

* It must not unlock before closing. A duplicate of the descriptor shares the
  lock rather than holding one of its own, so unlocking through any of them
  releases it for all. Measured on both POSIX and Windows: unlock-then-close
  left the lock free while a live process believed it held it. The kernel
  bookkeeping behind that differs by platform, but the rule does not.
* It must not treat a free lock as proof that nothing is running. The kernel
  frees the lock at the instant of death, and Chromium can still be shutting
  down. The margin is much smaller than an earlier note here claimed: that said
  "over twenty seconds", and re-measuring found 13-38 ms on this machine and
  11-103 ms independently, because Chromium is wired to its driver by
  ``--remote-debugging-pipe`` and exits when the pipe breaks. A direct collision
  test, five rounds with a successor pre-armed and spinning, produced no round
  with two live browsers on one profile.

  The rule stands regardless of the number, because it is about which question a
  lock answers: ownership and profile-idleness are separate, and what actually
  keeps two processes off one profile is the lease next door. The old figure is
  recorded here because it was load-bearing in the design that produced this
  file, and leaving it unqualified invites conclusions the measurement does not
  support.

Handing a held lock to another process works only on POSIX. Measured on
Windows: a child that inherited the handle through the documented mechanism did
not hold the lock once the parent had closed its handles and exited, in 20 of 20
runs. The two platforms genuinely differ here, so startup has to differ with
them rather than share one path that is only true on one of them.

#: Whether a held lock can be handed to another process by letting it inherit

#: description that every copy shares.

#: False on Windows, and this is measured rather than assumed. On a Windows
#: runner, a child that received the handle through the documented
#: ``STARTUPINFO`` handle list and kept it open did not hold the lock once the
#: parent had closed its handles and exited: a third process acquired the byte
#: range in 20 of 20 runs. Within one process a duplicate does keep the lock
#: alive, which is why this is easy to get wrong from a single-process test.
#: So on Windows the elected process has to take the lock itself rather than be
