"""Getting a login done in the process that can actually show one.

The owner drives the browser, so it is the process that *notices* bad LinkedIn
auth, and it has nobody in front of it, so it is the one that cannot fix it. Not
because it cannot open a browser: it can, and does when configured to run headed.
An interactive login is different in kind, because it waits for someone to type
credentials. The frontend is the opposite: it was spawned by an MCP client, a user
is there, and it can ask. This module carries the fact across the loopback hop between
them, and acts on it at the other end.

**Why a result and not an exception.** The owner's refusal has to survive
``ProxyProvider`` forwarding with its meaning intact, and an exception does not.
Measured against fastmcp 3.4.4: a middleware that re-raises delivered
``meta=None, isError=True, content=["Error calling tool 'x'"]`` to the outer
client, because ``mask_error_details`` is on and the type is gone by then. The
same middleware returning ``ToolResult(..., meta=..., is_error=True)`` delivered
the marker intact, and a client that raises on error still got its ``ToolError``
with the original message. The proxy copies ``meta`` and ``isError`` explicitly
(``fastmcp/server/providers/proxy.py:212-225``).

**Why the exception chain and not a ContextVar.** The owner-side middleware reads
``__cause__`` to find out what happened. A ``ContextVar`` set by the tool body
would also work, but only by accident: fastmcp runs ``async def`` tools inline and
offloads plain ``def`` tools to a thread, where the value set inside is invisible
to the middleware. Every tool here is ``async def`` today, so both would pass, and
one of them would break silently the first time that changed.

That chain reaching this far depends on ``raise_tool_error`` passing an
already-shaped ``ToolError`` through rather than re-deriving it. Before that fix
the missing-session path arrived as ``['ToolError']`` with the cause severed, and
this module could not have worked at all.

**What the frontend does with it.** Two fields, and they answer different
questions. ``reason`` says what to repair: a missing session needs a login, a
stale one needs the old session retired first. ``replayable`` says whether the
call may be run again afterwards, which depends on whether any work had happened
when it failed. Both combinations occur, so neither field implies the other.

Only the owner can decide ``replayable``, because every origin looks the same by
the time a failure reaches a client: all 18 tool catch sites collapse them into
one ``except`` clause.
