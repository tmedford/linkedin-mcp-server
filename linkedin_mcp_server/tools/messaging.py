        Compose and send a new message to a LinkedIn user.

        Profile-based targeting opens LinkedIn's compose flow. It is not a safe
        reply path for an existing recruiter/InMail or messaging thread: it may
        create a separate DM even after you inspect that thread with
        get_conversation or search_conversations. Those tools only read an
        existing thread; they do not send a reply. Until a thread-targeted send
        path is available, do not treat profile-based send_message as a reply.

        The recipient must be directly messageable from the profile page. If
        LinkedIn does not expose a normal Message action, use connect_with_person
        first, then retry send_message only after the connection request is
        accepted. Recipient authorization comes from validating one
        recipient-specific Message action carrying the target URN, then following
        its browser navigation and pinning the exact final route. Visible profile
        links or recipient URNs in the composer are optional corroboration; any
        contradiction fails closed. No Voyager or other private API is used. This
        is a write operation when confirm_send is True.

        Args:
            linkedin_username: LinkedIn username of the recipient; a full profile URL is accepted too
            message: Single-line message text to send. C0 control characters and
                DEL are rejected, including CR, LF, and tab.
            confirm_send: Must be True to send the message
            ctx: FastMCP context for progress reporting
            profile_urn: Optional profile URN (e.g. ACoAAB...) to verify against
                the URN exposed by the loaded profile before opening its Message
                action. It never bypasses recipient verification. Obtain via
                get_person_profile. Note: inbox may not always show all messages;
                use search_conversations as a fallback.

        Returns:
            Dict with url, status, message, recipient_selected, sent, and
            retry_safe. ``sent`` is true only after the submitted message's DOM
            node gains a different opaque event ID; this does not claim delivery
            or read status. It is false both where nothing was submitted and
            where the outcome is unknown. ``retry_safe`` separates the two: it
            is false from the moment a submission is attempted, and calling
            again while it is
            false can deliver the message twice.
