        When looked up by linkedin_username, resolution searches the messaging
        inbox for the participant's display name and click-visits every
        matching row to capture its thread ID — LinkedIn's sidebar has no
        anchor hrefs or thread-id attributes, so this is the only available

        Compose and send a new message to a LinkedIn user.

        Profile-based targeting opens LinkedIn's compose flow. It is not a safe
        reply path for an existing recruiter/InMail or messaging thread: it may
        create a separate DM even after you inspect that thread with
        get_conversation or search_conversations. Those tools only read an
        existing thread; they do not send a reply. Until a thread-targeted send
        path is available, do not treat profile-based send_message as a reply.

        The recipient must be directly messageable from the profile page. If
        LinkedIn does not expose a normal Message action, use connect_with_person
        first, then retry send_message only after the connection request is
        accepted. A ``status`` of ``enter_to_send_enabled`` means the account
        has LinkedIn's "Press Enter to Send" preference on, which hides the Send
        button; relay the returned instructions to the user, who switches it to
        "Click Send to send" before retrying. The dry run (confirm_send False)
        reports it too. Recipient authorization comes from validating one
        recipient-specific Message action carrying the target URN, then following
        its browser navigation and pinning the exact final route. Visible profile
        links or recipient URNs in the composer are optional corroboration; any
        contradiction fails closed. No Voyager or other private API is used. This
        is a write operation when confirm_send is True.

        ``thread_id`` is present only on ``sent``: the conversation the
        confirmed message was observed in, or null when the page stayed on
        the compose route. ``retry_safe`` stays the authority for whether a
        retry is safe.

        Args:
            linkedin_username: LinkedIn username of the recipient; a full profile URL is accepted too
            message: Message text. LF, CRLF and CR all end a line; an empty line
                separates paragraphs and is kept. Whitespace-only lines count as
                empty, and leading and trailing whitespace of the whole message
                is removed, as LinkedIn does when sending. Tab, other control
                characters, DEL, U+0085, U+2028 and U+2029 are refused.
            confirm_send: Must be True to send the message
            ctx: FastMCP context for progress reporting
            profile_urn: Optional profile URN (e.g. ACoAAB...) to verify against
                the URN exposed by the loaded profile before opening its Message
                action. It never bypasses recipient verification. Obtain via
                get_person_profile. Note: inbox may not always show all messages;
                use search_conversations as a fallback.

        Returns:
            Dict with url, status, message, recipient_selected, sent, and
            retry_safe. ``thread_id`` is present only on ``sent``. ``sent``
            is true only after the thread shows the submitted
            text under a new server message ID (or its DOM node gains a
            different event ID); this does not claim delivery or read status.
            It is false both where nothing was submitted and
            where the outcome is unknown. ``retry_safe`` separates the two: it
            is false from the moment a submission is attempted, and calling
            again while it is
            false can deliver the message twice. A ``status`` of
            ``outcome_unknown`` is that same warning from the transport rather
            than the page: the browser process went away with the call in
            flight, so ``sent`` is absent instead of false and only LinkedIn
            itself can say whether the message left.
