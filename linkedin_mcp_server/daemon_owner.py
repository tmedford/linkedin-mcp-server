"""The process that holds the browser and serves it over loopback.

Started by a frontend that wants a shared browser, and from then on independent
of it: it holds the daemon lock for its lifetime, listens on an ephemeral
loopback port, and drives the one Chromium every client shares.

"Independent" is a POSIX measurement, not a promise on every platform. There the
child leads its own session, and after ``SIGKILL`` to the frontend's whole
process group it was still running and had reparented to pid 1. Windows has no
equivalent in this code: ``start_new_session`` is POSIX-only
(``subprocess.py:795``), so nothing there detaches the child from a job object
that takes its parent down. That is worth revisiting before the flag is turned
on by default, and it is not a regression today, since the feature is opt-in.

The startup boundary is load-bearing. This child listens, proves its own
authenticated endpoint, and writes only a generation-specific pending descriptor.
The frontend validates that state and sends one commit record. The lock-holding
child then performs the same-directory replacement: EOF before the record aborts,
while parent loss after it cannot revoke an owner that may already be canonical.

The port is chosen by the kernel, so the socket is bound before the descriptor is
built. The endpoint is proved through the descriptor's own URL and token before
the child reports `prepared`; no globally discoverable state exists before that
proof. Publication belongs to the lock holder, so a stale Windows frontend can
never outlive its child and overwrite the next winner.

The child competes for the lock before opening its own log on every platform.
Keeping those potentially blocking state-storage operations behind the process
boundary lets the frontend enforce its deadline by killing this process. A timed-out
thread could later acquire the lock or publish over an in-process fallback; a
process with a pending hard kill cannot return to user space and do either.

    An error from ``os.replace`` can describe either side of the rename on NFS.
    Releasing the lock on that evidence lets a successor start before a delayed
    canonical entry names this endpoint. The lock holder therefore retries the
    same pending generation until a read observes it or a replacement succeeds.

    Every mutating retry stays synchronously in this task. Once one returns, its
    storage operation is over; only cached visibility may lag. That ordering lets a
    later lock holder safely replace this generation after a hard process exit. A
    worker left running outside this task would break the ordering by publishing
    after the lock had moved to a successor. Canonical reads are non-mutating, but
    an unavailable mount can block their native threads, so reconciliation reuses
    one in-flight read until it settles instead of creating one per retry. Short
    waits between checks keep call cancellation and stand-down handling alive for
    a descriptor that became visible before publication could be proved.

    There is deliberately no elapsed-time fallback. A persistent error that is not
    structurally definitive carries no proof that publication failed, so any timed
    release can admit a stale generation after its successor. The owner remains
    undiscoverable and holds the lock until storage recovers. Moving coordination
    state off remote storage, tracked by #796, is what can add a bounded terminal
    path without weakening this invariant.

    Every terminal path out of this loop is a hard exit, so *lock* comes in with
    the call: the exit releases the election before the process ends, and the
    profile lease alone keeps a successor off the browser.

    Turnover is the one terminal decision that waits first. Once it wins, no
    further publication is attempted for this generation, admission stays
    closed, and the calls already admitted get the serving loop's own drain
    (:func:`_turn_over`) while this process still holds the lock. The hard exit
    follows that, and follows it even if the drain itself is interrupted.
