"""A page in a window that never opens.

Headless mode is what makes a browser announce itself. Chromium prepends the
bare string ``Headless`` to the product name at runtime, so both the user agent
and the ``sec-ch-ua`` brand list read ``HeadlessChrome`` -- which is why no
change to *which* binary runs can remove it, only a change to the mode. But this
server must not put a window on somebody's desktop either.

Chromium can create a target with no UI window at all. The page behaves like an
ordinary one; it simply has nowhere to be drawn. Every value below was measured
before this was written, and the notes say which measurement decided what,
because three of these details are the difference between working and silently
not.

Not measured, and worth stating plainly: a window *is* on screen for about half
a second on every browser start, between Chromium opening its startup window and
this closing it. It cannot be shortened from here. Roughly 250 ms passes before
``launch_persistent_context()`` even returns, about 340 ms is macOS tearing the
window down after ``close()``, and the part this code controls is around 90 ms.
The only way to zero is for the browser never to open a window, which needs
``--no-startup-window``; that hangs Playwright for its full timeout
(https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/42093).

    """Whether this platform can work in a window that never opens.

    Two things have to be true, and only one of them is about displays.

    A headed browser needs a display server. Measured in the published
    container image: with no ``DISPLAY``, ``launch_persistent_context(
    headless=False)`` fails with a ``TargetClosedError`` before any of this code
    runs.

    And the browser has to survive losing its last visible window, because that
    is exactly what this does. Measured, same image, under Xvfb: closing the
    startup page kills Chromium and the hidden page dies with it, while keeping
    that page open leaves everything working. macOS does not quit an application
    when its last window closes, which is why the mechanism works there.

    So this is deliberately narrow. macOS is measured and supported. Windows is
    *not* measured -- it plausibly behaves like Linux -- and claiming it without
    looking would be the kind of guess this file exists to avoid. Everything
    else falls back to Chromium's headless mode and says so.

    Linux is not a gap so much as a different answer: under a virtual display
    nobody is looking at the screen, so an ordinary window is already invisible
    and there is nothing to hide. That is the container's path, and it belongs
    with the change that gives the container a display.
