"""What a running daemon publishes about itself, and what a client checks.

A client that finds a descriptor is about to send a bearer token to whatever
address it names and then drive a logged-in LinkedIn session through it. So
nothing here is taken on trust: the endpoint is checked to be loopback before
the token goes anywhere, the profile path is compared exactly, and the
configuration is compared through a fingerprint.

Two fields exist because of measurements rather than tidiness:

``profile_path`` and ``profile_identity``
    ``auth_root_dir`` returns the profile's *parent*, so ``.../profile`` and
    ``.../profile2`` share one auth root and therefore one lock. The path is
    retained for diagnostics; the identity is what is compared. It is built
    from the parent's inode and the profile's own name rather than the
    profile's inode, because the profile directory is replaced whenever a new
    session is established: keyed by its inode, a descriptor would stop
    matching its own profile at the first login. The parent's inode still
    settles the case and Unicode aliases that a bare string comparison gets
    wrong on an insensitive volume.

``config_fingerprint``
    Two clients that disagree about ``headless``, the user agent or the proxy
    are not interchangeable, because the owner's browser can only be one of
    them. The fingerprint is keyed rather than a plain digest: ``proxy_password``
    is part of what must match, and a plain hash over otherwise-guessable
    configuration would be an offline check for password guesses.

The token itself is deliberately *not* here. It lives beside the descriptor in
its own file, named after the instance, and the descriptor carries only its
digest. Fixed names would let a client pair one generation's descriptor with the
next generation's token and read that mismatch as corruption rather than as the
restart it is.

State lives under the account's own directory rather than under the auth root,
which is configurable and may be a directory this application does not own. One
consequence is worth stating before anything is wired to it: two containers
sharing a bind-mounted auth root do *not* share this state, because each has its
own home. Measured with two containers on one mounted profile: both saw the same
auth root identity and both took the lock. Whatever adopts this has to either
keep containers on the existing per-operation lease or give them a shared state
directory of their own.
