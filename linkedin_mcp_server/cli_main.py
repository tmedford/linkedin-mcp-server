    """Return the shared owner to forward to, starting one if nobody has.

    Off by default, and inert when off. ``None`` means this process serves its
    own client the way it always has: the flag is off, the transport is HTTP (one
    server for many clients already, so there is nothing to deduplicate), or no
    owner could be established at all.

    Never fatal, and that is a decision rather than an oversight. A client that
    refused to start because a shared browser could not be elected would fail
    where nobody can read the reason — an MCP client reports "server failed to
    start" and the explanation sits in a log the user has not opened. A working
    server with a warning beats a dead one with a better excuse while the flag is
    opt-in. It is a real trade, though: falling back means two clients can hand
    the profile back and forth per call again, which is the cost #606 exists to
    remove, so the warning is the only thing that says the feature was lost. The
    balance changes when the flag becomes the default.

    What keeps two processes off one profile on that fallback path is the profile
    lease from #598, not anything here: the owner takes it when it opens Chromium
    and hands it over when another process announces itself
    (``drivers/browser.watch_for_handoff_requests``). The daemon lock decides who
    *owns* the browser; the lease decides who is driving it right now.

    That safety net carries more weight on Windows than elsewhere, which is worth
    knowing before the flag becomes the default. A frontend there takes no lock
    at all and starts a child that competes for one
    (``daemon_election._start_contending_for_the_lock``), so a local spawn
    failure is indistinguishable from a rival owner that holds the lock and has
    not published yet: ``obtain_owner`` returns at once and this process falls
    back while an owner may in fact be coming up. On POSIX the equivalent
    outcomes are terminal, because the frontend held the lock itself. Windows
    already carries platform gaps that gate the default flip, and this is one of
    them.
