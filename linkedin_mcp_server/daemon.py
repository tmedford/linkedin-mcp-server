"""Decide whether this process attaches to a daemon, owns one, or goes it alone.

A stdio server is spawned per MCP client, and #598 made several of them safe on
one profile by passing the browser between them. Safe, but not cheap: ownership
moves on nearly every call, and every move reopens Chromium and revalidates the
session against ``/feed/``. One long-lived owner removes that traffic entirely.

This module is only the discovery half: it answers "is there an owner I should
be talking to, and may I trust it with a token". Electing one and spawning it
live in :mod:`linkedin_mcp_server.daemon_election`, and forwarding to what it
returns in :mod:`linkedin_mcp_server.daemon_proxy`.

Finding an owner takes a wait rather than a single read, because the interesting
case is neither "an owner exists" nor "none does", but the window in between. An
owner takes the lock first and publishes its descriptor only once it is actually
listening, so a client arriving in that gap loses the lock race while the file
still says whatever the *last* owner left there — nothing, or a descriptor that
outlived its writer. Settling on either reading is how a process ends up driving
its own browser against the same profile for its whole life, which is the
per-call handoff this feature exists to remove, and it is what two clients
starting together would normally hit.

One rule underpins the whole module: a file says nothing about whether the
process that wrote it still exists. Only :meth:`DaemonLock.try_acquire` settles
who owns the browser, and only connecting settles whether anything is listening.
Every place this module was wrong before, it was wrong by forgetting that — most
recently about ``ATTACHABLE`` itself, which an owner leaves behind intact when it
crashes after publishing.

That is also why the only entry point returns an :class:`OwnerLookup` rather
than an optional attachment. A convenience wrapper that handed back just the
attachment existed here and was removed: it let a caller act on "there is a
daemon" without the state that says how much that is worth.

    Every state but ``ATTACHABLE`` is waited out, not just ``ABSENT``. The
    tempting rule is that only ``ABSENT`` can turn into ``ATTACHABLE``, since a
    starting owner publishes late. It is wrong for the same reason every other
    mistake in this module was: a descriptor outlives the owner that wrote it,
    so a fresh owner mid-startup is read through the dead one's file. Measured
    on this tree — an owner that crashed serving a sibling profile reads as
    ``INCOMPATIBLE`` while its replacement is coming up.

    Stopping at ``ATTACHABLE`` is not the same claim. It says a compatible file
    is on disk, which is all a re-read can ever establish; the process that
    wrote it may be gone. A caller whose connection to that endpoint fails must
    go to the lock rather than conclude a daemon exists.

    Callers pass a wait only when they have reason to think an owner is
    starting, which in practice means having just lost the lock race. With the
    default of no wait this is a single read.

    *ignore_instances* names generations the caller has already judged unusable,

    instantly on a file the caller was going to throw away. Only the caller can
    know that: burial lives in :mod:`linkedin_mcp_server.daemon_election` and is
    established by connecting, which nothing here does. Without it a caller that
    asked for a wait got none, and its own retry loop spun through the whole
    backoff at read speed, starting a descriptor inspection thread and touching
    state storage on every pass. Named instances are therefore waited out like
    any other unusable state: the poll keeps watching the same file, so a *new*
    generation published over it is still picked up within one poll interval,
    and the buried endpoint is never contacted again. When the budget ends with
    nothing better, the reading is returned exactly as before, so the caller's
    own downgrade is unchanged.

    *for_retirement* is for a profile command deciding whether there is an owner
    to ask to retire: the configuration is not compared (``_inspect``). It is
    still only a reading of files, so nothing is contacted here either.
