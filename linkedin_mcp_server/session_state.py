    Every signal here has to describe our own process. That sounds obvious and
    is exactly what an earlier version got wrong: it searched ``mountinfo`` and
    ``cgroup`` for the substrings ``docker``, ``containerd`` and friends
    anywhere in the file. Those files list what the *namespace* can see, not
    what we are, so an ordinary Linux workstation running a Docker daemon for
    unrelated services — a local Postgres, a Redis — matched every time. The
    misdetection was permanent and unrecoverable: it sends
    ``get_runtime_policy`` to DOCKER, which answers every tool call with "run
    --login on the host machine" no matter how valid the session on disk is.

    A false negative is the worse failure, so the remaining signals are the
    conservative ones rather than the clever ones: a container that believed it
    was a host would try to auto-import from a browser keychain that is not
    there and offer login flows it cannot run.

    Deliberately *not* consulted: ``/run/systemd/container``, systemd's
    documented container interface. It answers a different question than this
    one. An OrbStack Linux machine reports ``lxc`` there, yet it is a full
    system with its own systemd, a persistent disk and a desktop-class user —
    everything the DOCKER policy assumes is missing. Trusting the marker
    classified it as a container and put it straight back into "run --login on
    the host machine", which is this bug wearing a different hat. What this
    module needs to know is not "is there a boundary" but "is there a browser
    and a keychain on the other side of it", and no single flag answers that.
    LXC and nspawn therefore stay reachable only through their cgroup layout,
    and where that is not enough, ``LINKEDIN_MCP_CONTAINER=true`` is.

    ``LINKEDIN_MCP_CONTAINER`` overrides the whole thing. Detection is a
    heuristic over other people's kernels, so it will be wrong somewhere, and

      Chromium. Authoritative, but only among processes that know about it.
    * Chromium's ``SingletonLock``, which catches a foreign holder — an older
      version, a container, a human with a browser open on the directory. Note it
      is written only by full Chrome: the default ``chrome-headless-shell`` never
      writes one, which is precisely why the lease exists.

    *wait_seconds* is for a caller that has reason to expect the holder to let
