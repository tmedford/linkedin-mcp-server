class OwnerCannotAuthenticateError(LinkedInMCPError):
    """The shared browser owner found bad auth and cannot fix it itself.

    A detached owner has nobody in front of it. It can open a browser, and does
    when configured to run headed, but an interactive login is different in kind:
    it waits for someone to type credentials and answer a challenge, and no client
    is attached to this process to do that. The same goes for a keychain prompt.
    It also must not move the shared profile aside: the process that will log in
    needs to find the session state as the owner saw it, and rotating from here
    would race that login for the same files.

    So the owner reports instead of acting, and the frontend, which is the process
    an MCP client actually spawned, does the work. These two carry which of the
    two situations it is, because the frontend's response differs:

    * missing means no usable session on disk, so a plain login is enough;
    * stale means a session that exists and no longer works, which has to be
      retired before a new one can replace it.

    Subclasses rather than one class with a field: they are raised from different
    places and the distinction has to survive being caught by type.

    ``nothing_ran_yet`` is carried separately from which subclass this is, because
    the two are independent and conflating them costs correctness. Whether the
    session is missing or stale says what has to be repaired; whether any work has
    happened says whether the call may be run again afterwards. Both combinations
    occur: a stale session is usually found by the readiness check before a tool
    has done anything, and only the owner can tell, because by the time a failure
    reaches a client every origin looks the same.

    It defaults to False so a path that has not thought about it is not replayed.

    metadata and the derived runtime profiles live one level above the profile
    itself. A mistyped path therefore costs a directory nobody meant to name.

    Distinct from an ordinary failure because the recovery differs: the profile
    must be left exactly as it is. Resetting it, restoring over it, or trying
    the next candidate would all write underneath a Chromium that may still be
    running.

    Raising it also asks a shared owner to stand down, because for that process
    the message below is not something anyone can act on: it outlives the client
    that started it, so restarting the client re-attaches to the same held
    profile. Measured live against a real detached owner, over a teardown that
    timed out after 10 seconds: three consecutive fresh clients each attached to
    the same wedged owner and got the same refusal.

    The request lives here rather than at the raise sites because that is what
    makes it complete. It sat at one site once, in ``handle_auth_error``, and the
    path this was measured on never goes through it: the failure came from
    ``_authenticate_existing_profile``, deep in the driver.

    Not sufficient on its own, though, and the reason is an ordering. This runs
    while the raise is still in flight, so a site that marks the profile held
    *after* constructing the error is invisible here and has to ask for itself;
    ``_create_browser`` is exactly that, and was measured wedged with this in
    place.
