# Clamp ceiling: page reading time stacks on top of the inline wait inside one tool
# call and the smallest MCP client timeout is ~60s, so the wait alone must stay
# well under that floor.
MAX_LOGIN_INLINE_WAIT_SECONDS: float = 45.0

# How long a tool call waits for another process to hand over the browser. Same
# budget and ceiling as the login inline wait, for the same reason: the wait is
# spent inside one tool call, ahead of the page read itself.
DEFAULT_BROWSER_WAIT_SECONDS: float = 25.0
MAX_BROWSER_WAIT_SECONDS: float = 45.0
# Shortest time an owner keeps the browser before honouring a handoff request.
# Every handoff costs a reopen, and a reopen re-validates /feed/, so handing over
# on literally every call would multiply LinkedIn requests. Matched to the wait
# budget: a longer window would push waiters past their own timeout.
DEFAULT_BROWSER_MIN_HOLD_SECONDS: float = 20.0
# Slack between the end of the hold window and the waiter's deadline: the owner
# notices on a one-second poll and then has to tear Chromium down (~0.7s
# measured). Without it a waiter gives up moments before the handover lands.
BROWSER_HANDOFF_MARGIN_SECONDS: float = 3.0
# How long a one-shot operation waits for another process to hand the profile
# over. A user-experience limit rather than a derived worst case, and the
# distinction is worth stating because the arithmetic invites the wrong one: an
# idle holder does release quickly, after browser_min_hold_seconds plus about a
# second of teardown, but a holder running a tool call refuses to hand over at
# all until that call ends (`drivers/browser.py`), and a call may take up to
# tool_timeout_seconds. So this does not bound every cooperative case. It bounds
# how long someone who just asked to sign in is left staring at nothing, and past
# it they are told the browser is busy, which they can act on. Waiting three
# minutes in silence is the worse answer.
#
# Deliberately not configurable. Nothing measured suggests a user would need to
# tune it, and an unused setting is a support burden.
PROFILE_HANDOVER_WAIT_SECONDS: float = 60.0

# What fraction of a tool call a frontend may spend waiting for the sign-in it
# started, before answering without it.
#
# A fraction rather than a number of seconds, because the bound that matters is
# the call this wait is spent inside, and ``tool_timeout_seconds`` is something
# the user sets. A fixed value was measured against ``TOOL_TIMEOUT=60``: the
# client's call was cut short while the middleware was still waiting, so instead
# of the readable "sign-in still in progress" the user got a bare timeout. The
# login survived it and the next call succeeded, so nothing was lost but the
# explanation -- which is the part a person acts on.
#
# Five sixths leaves the remaining sixth for the replayed call, which is the
# whole point of having waited. Somebody still typing when it runs out loses only
# this attempt: the login keeps running and the next call finds what it wrote.
AUTH_REPAIR_LOGIN_WAIT_FRACTION: float = 5 / 6

# Close an idle browser and release the profile after this long with no calls.
# A backstop only — the handoff signal does the real work — so it is deliberately

#: Spelled with ``~`` rather than resolved here so it follows the account that
