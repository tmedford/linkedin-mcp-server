| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_person_profile` | Get profile info with explicit section selection (experience, education, interests, honors, languages, certifications, skills, projects, contact_info, posts) |
| `get_my_profile` | Get the authenticated user's own LinkedIn profile (same sections as get_person_profile) |
| `connect_with_person` | Send a connection request or accept an incoming one, with optional note |
| `get_sidebar_profiles` | Extract profile URLs from sidebar recommendation sections ("More profiles for you", "Explore premium profiles", "People you may know") on a profile page |
| `get_inbox` | List recent conversations from the LinkedIn messaging inbox |
| `get_conversations` | Read one page (25) of conversations from the messaging API, cursor-paged. Reaches the whole mailbox and clicks nothing, so no thread is marked read; each row carries thread urn, participants, last activity, read state and whether a reply is owed. Pass `next_cursor` back as `cursor` for the next page |
| `get_conversation` | Read a specific messaging conversation by username or thread ID |
| `search_conversations` | Search messages by keyword |
| `send_message` | Compose/send a new message to a LinkedIn user (requires confirmation; profile-based targeting may open a separate DM instead of replying in an existing thread — see #483) |
| `get_mutual_connections` | Page through the connections you share with a person, with LinkedIn's own total and its suggested introduction ask for each. These are the people who could introduce you |
| `get_person_posts` | Read a person's posts and reposts from the API, with real timestamps, engagement counts, and the original of anything reshared |
| `reply_to_thread` | Reply inside an existing messaging thread, named by its thread id or `thread_url` (requires confirmation). Pinned to that thread: if LinkedIn opens anything else, nothing is typed. Use this instead of `send_message` when the conversation already exists, including InMail and Open Profile threads the profile-based path cannot reach |
| `get_company_profile` | Extract company information with explicit section selection (posts, jobs); about-section references may include a `company_urn` entry carrying the numeric id used by LinkedIn's people-search `currentCompany` URL facet |
| `get_company_posts` | Get recent posts from a company's LinkedIn feed |
| `search_companies` | Search for companies on LinkedIn by keywords |
| `get_company_employees` | List employees at a company from the /people/ page, with optional keyword filter |
| `search_jobs` | Search for jobs with keywords and location filters |
| `get_saved_jobs` | List job postings saved by the authenticated user |
| `search_people` | Search for people by keywords, location, connection degree (1st/2nd/3rd), and current company |
| `get_job_details` | Get detailed information about a specific job posting |
| `get_feed` | Get recent posts from the authenticated user's home feed |
| `search_posts` | Search posts/content globally by keyword (the "Posts" tab) with an optional recency filter (past-24h/past-week/past-month) |
| `close_session` | Close browser session and clean up resources |

## 🚀 uvx Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:** [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Installation

**Client Configuration**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-linkedin": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-linkedin@latest"],
      "env": { "UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT": "300" }
    }
  }
}
```

The `@latest` tag turns on automatic updates, which keep the server working with LinkedIn's current page structure. The server starts quickly, prepares the shared Patchright Chromium browser cache in the background under `~/.linkedin-mcp/patchright-browsers`, and opens a LinkedIn login browser window on the first tool call that needs authentication.

AI agent? Get a quick confirmation from the user before enabling automatic updates.

> [!NOTE]
> Early tool calls may return a setup/authentication-in-progress error until browser setup or login finishes. If you prefer to create a session explicitly, run `uvx mcp-server-linkedin@latest --login`.

### uvx Setup Help

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Configuration</b></summary>

<details>
<summary>Transport modes</summary>

- **Default (stdio)**: Standard communication for local MCP servers
- **Streamable HTTP**: For a web-based MCP server
- If no transport is specified, the server defaults to `stdio`
- An interactive terminal without explicit transport shows a chooser prompt

</details>

<details>
<summary>CLI options</summary>

**Session:**

- `--login` - Open a browser to sign in and save the session
- `--import-from-browser [BROWSER]` - Reuse a session from a locally signed-in Chromium browser (`chrome`, `chromium`, `brave`, `edge`, `arc`, `vivaldi`, `helium`, `yandex`, `whale`, `auto`). Bare flag picks `auto`, the most recently used browser with a live LinkedIn session.
- `--auto-import` / `--no-auto-import` - Import a session from a signed-in local browser on the first tool call that needs one, before falling back to manual login (default: on). Skipped in Docker, behind a proxy, and on a non-loopback HTTP bind. On macOS the keychain may prompt once.
- `--logout` - Clear the stored session
- `--login-viewer` - Docker only: show the `--login` browser at a token-protected URL on port 6080 (see [Authentication](#authentication))
- `--user-data-dir PATH` - Browser profile directory (default: ~/.linkedin-mcp/profile). Rotating or clearing a session deletes this directory *and its parent*, which holds the stored cookies and derived profiles.
- `--claim-profile-root` - Take over a profile directory the server will not claim on its own, such as one whose parent already holds other files. Needed once per directory.

**Transport:**

- `--transport {stdio,streamable-http}` - Force the transport mode (default: stdio)
- `--host HOST` / `--port PORT` / `--path PATH` - HTTP server address (defaults: 127.0.0.1, 8000, /mcp)

**Timeouts:**

- `--timeout MS` - Timeout for a single page operation (default: 5000)
- `--tool-timeout SECONDS` - Timeout for a whole tool call (default: 180). Raise it for heavy scrapes, slow networks, or a cold-start browser.
- `--login-timeout SECONDS` - How long the login browser waits for you to finish signing in (default: 1800; 0 = no limit). `--login-viewer` ends the session after 30 minutes either way.
- `--login-inline-wait SECONDS` - How long a tool call waits for a login to finish before telling the model to retry (default: 25, max 45; 0 = return at once)

**Shared browser:**

- `--browser-wait SECONDS` - How long to wait for another server process to hand over the shared browser (default: 25, max 45; 0 = report busy at once). Only matters with several MCP clients running at once.
- `--browser-min-hold SECONDS` - Shortest time this process keeps the shared browser before handing it over (default: 20). Clamped to 3 seconds below `--browser-wait`, so raise that one along with it. Higher means fewer browser restarts but longer waits for other clients.
- `--browser-idle-timeout SECONDS` - Close an idle browser and release the profile after this long without a tool call (default: 600; 0 = keep it open)

**Browser:**

- `--no-headless` - Show the browser window (useful for debugging)
- `--chrome-path PATH` - Path to a Chrome/Chromium executable
- `--proxy-server URL` - Route browser traffic through a proxy, as `scheme://host:port`. Set it up **before** `--login`; see [Using a proxy](#using-a-proxy).

**Other:**

- `--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}` - Logging level (default: WARNING)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Import a session from your everyday browser</summary>

If you are already signed into LinkedIn in Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge, Arc, Vivaldi, Helium, Yandex, or Naver Whale, you can skip the manual `--login` step and reuse that session:

```bash
# Auto-pick the most recently used browser with a live LinkedIn session
uvx mcp-server-linkedin@latest --import-from-browser
# Or target a specific browser
uvx mcp-server-linkedin@latest --import-from-browser brave
```

This reads the browser's LinkedIn cookies, validates them against your feed, and saves them to `~/.linkedin-mcp/profile/`, the same place `--login` writes to. Notes:

- With several signed-in browsers, the most recently used live LinkedIn session is tried first. If LinkedIn rejects it (revoked or remote-logged-out), the next most recent is tried automatically; the first the server accepts is imported. There is no prompt to pick. Pass a browser name to target one specifically.
- On macOS the OS keychain may prompt to allow access to the browser's Safe Storage. Close the source browser first for the most reliable read.
- Cookies protected by Chrome 127+ app-bound encryption (`v20`) cannot be decrypted without OS elevation; in that case use `--login` instead.
- Imported cookies match a real login's on-disk set. The local server reads them back in full from the saved profile; the Docker bridge narrows to the same minimal auth subset it uses for a normal session.

</details>

<details>
<summary>HTTP mode and debugging</summary>

**Basic Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Run with debug logging
uvx mcp-server-linkedin@latest --log-level DEBUG
```

**HTTP Mode Example (for web-based MCP clients):**

```bash
uvx mcp-server-linkedin@latest --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --path /mcp
```

Runtime server logs are emitted by FastMCP/Uvicorn.

Tool calls are serialized to protect the shared LinkedIn browser session, both
within one server process and across separate ones. If you run several MCP
clients at once, each starts its own server process, and only one of them uses
the browser at a time; the others wait briefly and take over as soon as it
finishes a call. A client that waits too long gets a "browser is busy" message
and can simply retry. Use `--log-level DEBUG` to see the wait/acquire/release
logs.

This covers processes on the same machine and in the same runtime. It does not
extend between the host and a Docker container sharing the same
`~/.linkedin-mcp` directory, so do not run `--login` or `--logout` on the host
while a container is running.

**Test with mcp inspector:**

1. Install and run mcp inspector ```bunx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector```
2. Click pre-filled token url to open the inspector in your browser
3. Select `Streamable HTTP` as `Transport Type`
4. Set `URL` to `http://localhost:8080/mcp`
5. Connect
6. Test tools

<summary><b>❗ Troubleshooting</b></summary>

<details>
<summary>Installation issues</summary>

- Ensure you have uv installed: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Check uv version: `uv --version` (should be 0.4.0 or higher)
- On first run, `uvx` downloads all Python dependencies. On slow connections, uv's default 30s HTTP timeout may be too short. The recommended config above already sets `UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=300` (seconds) to avoid this.
- *Windows, `DLL load failed while importing _greenlet`*: move to greenlet 3.5.5 or newer, whose published Windows wheels carry the C++ runtime inside the extension again. A fresh `uvx` run resolves that on its own; an environment that pins its dependencies needs `uv lock --upgrade-package greenlet`. Only greenlet 3.3.1 through 3.5.4 need `MSVCP140.dll`, which neither the python.org installer nor the `uv`-managed builds carry, and a greenlet built from source can need it at any version. Where the version cannot be moved, the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) supplies that DLL. Reported as [greenlet#525](https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/525), fixed in [greenlet#526](https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/pull/526).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Session issues</summary>

- Browser profile is stored at `~/.linkedin-mcp/profile/`
- Managed browser downloads are cached at `~/.linkedin-mcp/patchright-browsers/`
- *The browser cache keeps growing*: a server upgrade can bring a new Chromium revision, and Patchright keeps the old one for as long as any installed version still references it. `uvx` keeps one archive per version you have ever run, so every one of them holds such a reference and the old revisions stay. The server logs a warning naming the revisions it is holding and how much space they take. To reclaim it, stop every LinkedIn MCP Server instance, delete `~/.linkedin-mcp/patchright-browsers/`, and let the next launch download the current browser.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Login issues</summary>

- Make sure you have only one active LinkedIn session at a time
- LinkedIn may require a login confirmation in the LinkedIn mobile app for `--login`
- LinkedIn may show a captcha challenge during login. Run `uvx mcp-server-linkedin@latest --login` which opens a browser where you can solve it manually.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Timeout issues</summary>

- *Page operations failing* (elements not found, navigation hangs): increase the browser page-op timeout: `--timeout 10000` or `TIMEOUT=10000` (milliseconds, default 5000).
- *Entire tool calls timing out* (e.g. multi-section profiles, cold-start Chromium, slow containers): increase the per-tool execution timeout: `--tool-timeout 300` or `TOOL_TIMEOUT=300` (seconds, default 180).
- *First tool call with no session*: if a locally logged-in browser has a live LinkedIn session, the server auto-imports it (see `AUTO_IMPORT_FROM_BROWSER` / `--auto-import`) instead of forcing a manual login. On macOS the keychain may prompt once for Safe Storage access. If no importable browser session exists, it falls back to opening a login window and waits up to `LOGIN_INLINE_WAIT` seconds (default 25, max 45; `--login-inline-wait`) so a quick sign-in resolves in one call. If the wait elapses, the tool returns a pending signal and the model retries in about 30 seconds. Neither the auto-import nor the inline wait applies under Docker or when the server is bound to a non-loopback HTTP host. Create the session on the host with `--login`, or use the explicit Docker `--login --login-viewer` command.
- Users on slow connections may need higher values for either.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Told to run <code>--login</code> on the host when you already did</summary>

- If tool calls answer "No valid LinkedIn session is available in Docker" on a machine that is *not* a container, the runtime was misdetected. This happened on Linux hosts running a Docker daemon for unrelated services. Set `LINKEDIN_MCP_CONTAINER=false` to override the detection; `true` forces the opposite.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Custom Chrome path</summary>

- If Chrome is installed in a non-standard location, use `--chrome-path /path/to/chrome`
- Can also set via environment variable: `CHROME_PATH=/path/to/chrome`
- On macOS and Linux the browser must be at least as new as the one that last opened your profile, and the server refuses the launch otherwise. (Not on Windows: a browser there cannot be asked its version without starting one, so the check is off.) An older browser can silently drop stores a newer one wrote, the saved session among them, and the failure then looks exactly like an expired login. The message names both versions. Going back to the bundled Chromium after running a newer Chrome once is the usual way to meet this; either run the newer browser again, whichever one that was, or run `--login`, which moves the stored session aside and signs in fresh with the browser you have. `--logout` also clears it but discards the old session instead of keeping it recoverable, and it asks for confirmation on the terminal, so it is not usable from a server an MCP client started.
- Only Chrome, Chromium and Chrome for Testing are compared this way. Forks number themselves differently (Vivaldi is on 7.x, Edge's build number sits far below Chrome's under the same major), so pointing `CHROME_PATH` at one turns the check off rather than producing a refusal nothing could satisfy.

## 📦 Claude Desktop MCP Bundle (formerly DXT)

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).

**One-click installation** for Claude Desktop users:

1. Download the latest `.mcpb` artifact from [releases](https://github.com/stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server/releases/latest)
2. Click the downloaded `.mcpb` file to install it into Claude Desktop
3. Call any LinkedIn tool

On startup, the MCP Bundle starts preparing the shared Patchright Chromium browser cache in the background. If you call a tool too early, Claude will surface a setup-in-progress error. On the first tool call that needs authentication, the server opens a LinkedIn login browser window and asks you to retry after sign-in.

### MCP Bundle Setup Help

<details>
<summary><b>❗ Troubleshooting</b></summary>

<details>
<summary>First-time setup behavior</summary>

- Claude Desktop starts the bundle immediately; browser setup continues in the background
- If the Patchright Chromium browser is still downloading, retry the tool after a short wait
- Managed browser downloads are shared under `~/.linkedin-mcp/patchright-browsers/`
- *The browser cache keeps growing*: Patchright keeps an old Chromium revision for as long as any installed version still references it, so an upgrade can leave both on disk. The server logs a warning naming what it holds. To reclaim the space, stop every LinkedIn MCP Server instance, delete `~/.linkedin-mcp/patchright-browsers/`, and let the next launch download the current browser.
- *Windows, the bundle exits with `DLL load failed while importing _greenlet`*: install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist), or reinstall a bundle pinning greenlet 3.5.5 or newer, whose published Windows wheels carry the C++ runtime inside the extension again. A bundle pinning greenlet 3.3.1 through 3.5.4 needs `MSVCP140.dll` from that redistributable, which neither the python.org installer nor the `uv`-managed builds carry, and a greenlet built from source can need it at any version. The server names this itself on startup, and only after checking that the loader cannot produce that DLL. Reported as [greenlet#525](https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/525), fixed in [greenlet#526](https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/pull/526).

## 🐳 Docker Setup

<details>
<summary><strong>I know what I'm doing</strong></summary>
**Prerequisites:** Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is installed and running.

### Authentication

Log in once. The container opens a LinkedIn login browser that you drive from your own browser tab.

macOS / Linux:

```bash
# Create the directory first so the container can save your session into it
mkdir -p ~/.linkedin-mcp
docker run -it --rm \
  -v ~/.linkedin-mcp:/home/pwuser/.linkedin-mcp \
  -p 127.0.0.1:6080:6080 \
  stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server:latest \
  --login --login-viewer
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
$sessionDir = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE ".linkedin-mcp"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $sessionDir | Out-Null
docker run -it --rm `
  -v "${sessionDir}:/home/pwuser/.linkedin-mcp" `
  -p 127.0.0.1:6080:6080 `
  stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server:latest `
  --login --login-viewer
```

Open the full URL the command prints (it carries the access token) and sign in. The viewer closes itself afterwards; let the command exit on its own so the session is stored completely. It gives up after 30 minutes.

Keep the same host directory mounted at `/home/pwuser/.linkedin-mcp` on every later `docker run`, otherwise the server cannot find the session.

**Configure Claude Desktop with Docker**

**macOS / Linux (absolute path in JSON):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-linkedin": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-v", "/absolute/path/to/.linkedin-mcp:/home/pwuser/.linkedin-mcp",
        "stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Spell that first path out in full. A client runs `docker` directly rather than through a shell, so a leading `~` reaches Docker unexpanded and it refuses the mount.

**PowerShell (Windows):** use a forward-slash JSON path. A backslash path like
`C:\Users\Alice\.linkedin-mcp` fails JSON parsing because `\U` is an invalid
escape. Use `C:/Users/Alice/.linkedin-mcp` instead, replacing `Alice` with your
username.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-linkedin": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-v", "C:/Users/Alice/.linkedin-mcp:/home/pwuser/.linkedin-mcp",
        "stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> In PowerShell, `~` is not expanded inside a composite Docker `-v` argument.
> Use `C:/Users/<you>/.linkedin-mcp` or build the path with
> `$env:USERPROFILE\.linkedin-mcp` before passing it to Docker.

> [!NOTE]
> Sessions expire over time. When tool calls start asking for authentication, repeat the login command above, or run `uvx mcp-server-linkedin@latest --login` on the host.

### Docker Setup Help

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Configuration</b></summary>

<details>
<summary>Transport modes</summary>

- **Default (stdio)**: Standard communication for local MCP servers
- **Streamable HTTP**: For a web-based MCP server
- If no transport is specified, the server defaults to `stdio`
- An interactive terminal without explicit transport shows a chooser prompt

</details>

<details>
<summary>CLI options</summary>

**Session:**

- `--auto-import` / `--no-auto-import` - Import a session from a signed-in local browser on the first tool call that needs one, before falling back to manual login (ignored in Docker). On macOS the keychain may prompt once.
- `--logout` - Clear the stored session and every profile derived from it
- `--login-viewer` - With `--login`, show the login browser at a token-protected URL on port 6080. Needs the profile mount from [Authentication](#authentication).
- `--user-data-dir PATH` - Browser profile directory (default: ~/.linkedin-mcp/profile). Rotating or clearing a session deletes this directory *and its parent*, which holds the stored cookies and derived profiles.
- `--claim-profile-root` - Take over a profile directory the server will not claim on its own, such as one whose parent already holds other files. Needed once per directory.

**Transport:**

- `--transport {stdio,streamable-http}` - Force the transport mode (default: stdio)
- `--host HOST` / `--port PORT` / `--path PATH` - HTTP server address (defaults: 127.0.0.1, 8000, /mcp)

**Timeouts:**

- `--timeout MS` - Timeout for a single page operation (default: 5000)
- `--tool-timeout SECONDS` - Timeout for a whole tool call (default: 180). Raise it for heavy scrapes, slow networks, or a cold-start browser.
- `--login-timeout SECONDS` - How long the login browser waits for you to finish signing in (default: 1800; 0 = no limit). `--login-viewer` ends the session after 30 minutes either way.
- `--login-inline-wait SECONDS` - How long a tool call waits for a login to finish before telling the model to retry (default: 25, max 45; 0 = return at once)

**Shared browser:**

- `--browser-wait SECONDS` - How long to wait for another server process to hand over the shared browser (default: 25, max 45; 0 = report busy at once). Only matters with several MCP clients running at once.
- `--browser-min-hold SECONDS` - Shortest time this process keeps the shared browser before handing it over (default: 20). Clamped to 3 seconds below `--browser-wait`, so raise that one along with it. Higher means fewer browser restarts but longer waits for other clients.
- `--browser-idle-timeout SECONDS` - Close an idle browser and release the profile after this long without a tool call (default: 600; 0 = keep it open)

**Browser:**

- `--chrome-path PATH` - Path to a Chrome/Chromium executable (rarely needed in Docker)
- `--proxy-server URL` - Route browser traffic through a proxy, as `scheme://host:port`. Set it up **before** `--login`; see [Using a proxy](#using-a-proxy).

**Other:**

- `--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}` - Logging level (default: WARNING)

> [!NOTE]
> Plain `--login` still has no visible window in Docker. Add `--login-viewer` and publish `127.0.0.1:6080:6080` only for the one-shot login command. Docker is already headed by default, so `--no-headless` changes nothing. The experimental `--daemon` is ignored in Docker because its owner can outlive the virtual display.

</details>

<details>
<summary>HTTP mode</summary>

**HTTP Mode Example (for web-based MCP clients):**

Bash / macOS / Linux:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v ~/.linkedin-mcp:/home/pwuser/.linkedin-mcp \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server:latest \
  --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --path /mcp
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
$sessionDir = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE ".linkedin-mcp"
docker run -it --rm `
  -v "${sessionDir}:/home/pwuser/.linkedin-mcp" `
  -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 `
  stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server:latest `
  --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --path /mcp
```

Both halves of that are needed, and they do different jobs. `--host 0.0.0.0`
makes the server reachable *inside* the container: a process bound to
`127.0.0.1` in there cannot be reached through a published port at all. The
`127.0.0.1:` in front of `-p` is what limits it *outside*, to this machine.
Drop that prefix and Docker publishes on every interface, which puts an
endpoint with no authentication on your network. The server cannot tell the two
apart, so it warns either way.

Loopback publishing limits this to the machine, not to the container. Other
containers on the same host can still reach it through `host.docker.internal`
wherever that name resolves, which is the default on Docker Desktop and
OrbStack but not on native Linux Docker.

Runtime server logs are emitted by FastMCP/Uvicorn.

The HTTP server answers requests addressed to `localhost` or to the address it
is bound to, and refuses others with `421`. That is what stops a website you
merely visit from pointing a domain at this server and using your LinkedIn
session through your own browser.

Reaching the server by any other name is refused, including a machine name on
your network and the public name in front of a reverse proxy. Either have the
proxy rewrite the upstream `Host` to the backend address, or name the host you
serve it under:

```bash
FASTMCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS='["mcp.example"]'
```

That permits exactly that name and keeps refusing everything else. The endpoint
still has no authentication, so anything reachable beyond your own machine
belongs behind something that provides it.

**Test with mcp inspector:**

1. Install and run mcp inspector ```bunx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector```
2. Click pre-filled token url to open the inspector in your browser
3. Select `Streamable HTTP` as `Transport Type`
4. Set `URL` to `http://localhost:8080/mcp`
5. Connect
6. Test tools

<details>
<summary><b>❗ Troubleshooting</b></summary>

<details>
<summary>Docker issues</summary>

- Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is installed
- Check if Docker is running: `docker ps`
- *Permission errors on `~/.linkedin-mcp`*: an older rootful Docker run may have created the directory as root. Fix it with `sudo chown -R "$(id -u):$(id -g)" ~/.linkedin-mcp`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Login issues</summary>

- Make sure you have only one active LinkedIn session at a time
- LinkedIn may require a login confirmation in the LinkedIn mobile app for `--login`
- LinkedIn may show a captcha challenge during login. Run `uvx mcp-server-linkedin@latest --login` which opens a browser where you can solve captchas manually. See the [uvx setup](#-uvx-setup-recommended---universal) for prerequisites.
- If Docker auth becomes stale after you re-login on the host, restart Docker once so it can fresh-bridge from the new source session generation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Timeout issues</summary>

- *Page operations failing* (elements not found, navigation hangs): increase the browser page-op timeout: `--timeout 10000` or `TIMEOUT=10000` (milliseconds, default 5000).
- *Entire tool calls timing out* (e.g. multi-section profiles, cold-start Chromium, slow containers): increase the per-tool execution timeout: `--tool-timeout 300` or `TOOL_TIMEOUT=300` (seconds, default 180).
- *First tool call with no session*: if a locally logged-in browser has a live LinkedIn session, the server auto-imports it (see `AUTO_IMPORT_FROM_BROWSER` / `--auto-import`) instead of forcing a manual login. On macOS the keychain may prompt once for Safe Storage access. If no importable browser session exists, it falls back to opening a login window and waits up to `LOGIN_INLINE_WAIT` seconds (default 25, max 45; `--login-inline-wait`) so a quick sign-in resolves in one call. If the wait elapses, the tool returns a pending signal and the model retries in about 30 seconds. Neither the auto-import nor the inline wait applies under Docker or when the server is bound to a non-loopback HTTP host. Create the session on the host with `--login`, or use the explicit Docker `--login --login-viewer` command.
- Users on slow connections may need higher values for either.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Told to run <code>--login</code> on the host when you already did</summary>

- If tool calls answer "No valid LinkedIn session is available in Docker" on a machine that is *not* a container, the runtime was misdetected. This happened on Linux hosts running a Docker daemon for unrelated services. Set `LINKEDIN_MCP_CONTAINER=false` to override the detection; `true` forces the opposite.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Custom Chrome path</summary>

- If Chrome is installed in a non-standard location, use `--chrome-path /path/to/chrome`
- Can also set via environment variable: `CHROME_PATH=/path/to/chrome`
- On macOS and Linux the browser must be at least as new as the one that last opened your profile, and the server refuses the launch otherwise. (Not on Windows: a browser there cannot be asked its version without starting one, so the check is off.) An older browser can silently drop stores a newer one wrote, the saved session among them, and the failure then looks exactly like an expired login. The message names both versions. Going back to the bundled Chromium after running a newer Chrome once is the usual way to meet this; either run the newer browser again, whichever one that was, or run `--login`, which moves the stored session aside and signs in fresh with the browser you have. `--logout` also clears it but discards the old session instead of keeping it recoverable, and it asks for confirmation on the terminal, so it is not usable from a server an MCP client started.
- Only Chrome, Chromium and Chrome for Testing are compared this way. Forks number themselves differently (Vivaldi is on 7.x, Edge's build number sits far below Chrome's under the same major), so pointing `CHROME_PATH` at one turns the check off rather than producing a refusal nothing could satisfy.
- In the documented Docker setup this check does not apply. The container never opens the profile you created with `--login`; it derives its own from your cookies, and by default rebuilds that from scratch on every start, so there is nothing for an older image to downgrade. With `EXPERIMENTAL_PERSIST_DERIVED_RUNTIME` the derived profile is kept, and an image tag that moves backwards then throws it away and re-derives it, again with nothing for you to do. The check matters on the host, where the server opens that profile directly. Not during `--login` itself, which moves the old profile aside before it starts a browser and so can never trip it.

LinkedIn scores the address a session signs in from. Your account's usual IP address is the safe one. You should use a proxy in your country when the server cannot use it: a VPS, another country, or a second account that must not share the first one's address.

Take a dedicated static ISP address and keep it. From a residential pool, use a sticky session that holds one address (never per-request rotation). A WireGuard or Tailscale connection to your home network works too.

**Setup:**

- Set the proxy up **before** `--login`. Moving an existing session to a new address triggers a LinkedIn checkpoint. That includes a session from `--import-from-browser`, which was created on your real address.
- `--proxy-server scheme://host:port` or `PROXY_SERVER`, with `http`, `https`, `socks4` or `socks5`. Only browser traffic is routed, not the MCP transport.
- Pass credentials through `PROXY_USERNAME` and `PROXY_PASSWORD`, or include them in `PROXY_SERVER` using the combined `http://user:pass@host:port` form. The combined form is not accepted by the `--proxy-server` CLI option.
- `PROXY_BYPASS=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1` reaches local targets directly. With a proxy set, Chromium routes `localhost` through it too.

<details>
<summary>Pitfalls</summary>

- Chromium cannot authenticate to a SOCKS proxy, so credentials require an `http(s)` endpoint. If your provider only offers authenticated SOCKS5, run a local relay that holds the credentials and point the server at that.
- A wrong proxy password shows up as a timeout or a failed sign-in, because Chromium retries the authentication challenge until the page times out. If sessions stop working right after you add a proxy, check the proxy credentials first.
- Auto-import is skipped while a proxy is configured: the imported session would move from your real address to the proxy. Use `--login`.
- Inside a container `127.0.0.1` is the container itself, so a relay on the host is `host.docker.internal`; native Linux Docker also needs `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`.

<summary><b>🔧 Configuration</b></summary>

<details>
<summary>CLI options</summary>

**Session:**

- `--login` - Open a browser to sign in and save the session
- `--import-from-browser [BROWSER]` - Reuse a session from a locally signed-in Chromium browser (`chrome`, `chromium`, `brave`, `edge`, `arc`, `vivaldi`, `helium`, `yandex`, `whale`, `auto`). Bare flag picks `auto`, the most recently used browser with a live LinkedIn session.
- `--auto-import` / `--no-auto-import` - Import a session from a signed-in local browser on the first tool call that needs one, before falling back to manual login (default: on). Skipped in Docker, behind a proxy, and on a non-loopback HTTP bind. On macOS the keychain may prompt once.
- `--status` - Check whether the stored session is valid, then exit
- `--logout` - Clear the stored session
- `--user-data-dir PATH` - Browser profile directory (default: ~/.linkedin-mcp/profile). Rotating or clearing a session deletes this directory *and its parent*, which holds the stored cookies and derived profiles.
- `--claim-profile-root` - Take over a profile directory the server will not claim on its own, such as one whose parent already holds other files. Needed once per directory.

**Transport:**

- `--transport {stdio,streamable-http}` - Force the transport mode (default: stdio)
- `--host HOST` / `--port PORT` / `--path PATH` - HTTP server address (defaults: 127.0.0.1, 8000, /mcp)

**Timeouts:**

- `--timeout MS` - Timeout for a single page operation (default: 5000)
- `--tool-timeout SECONDS` - Timeout for a whole tool call (default: 180). Raise it for heavy scrapes, slow networks, or a cold-start browser.
- `--login-timeout SECONDS` - How long the login browser waits for you to finish signing in (default: 1800; 0 = no limit). `--login-viewer` ends the session after 30 minutes either way.
- `--login-inline-wait SECONDS` - How long a tool call waits for a login to finish before telling the model to retry (default: 25, max 45; 0 = return at once)

**Shared browser:**

- `--browser-wait SECONDS` - How long to wait for another server process to hand over the shared browser (default: 25, max 45; 0 = report busy at once). Only matters with several MCP clients running at once.
- `--browser-min-hold SECONDS` - Shortest time this process keeps the shared browser before handing it over (default: 20). Clamped to 3 seconds below `--browser-wait`, so raise that one along with it. Higher means fewer browser restarts but longer waits for other clients.
- `--browser-idle-timeout SECONDS` - Close an idle browser and release the profile after this long without a tool call (default: 600; 0 = keep it open)

**Browser:**

- `--no-headless` - Show the browser window (useful for debugging)
- `--slow-mo MS` - Delay between browser actions (default: 0, useful for debugging)
- `--viewport WxH` - Viewport size (default: 1280x720). Applies to windowless mode only; a headed launch uses the real window size.
- `--chrome-path PATH` - Path to a Chrome/Chromium executable
- `--installer-temp-dir PATH` - Parent directory for temporary files created during browser installation bootstrap (default: system temporary directory). Useful when system %TEMP% ancestry has non-standard ACLs or permissions.
- `--proxy-server URL` - Route browser traffic through a proxy, as `scheme://host:port`. Set it up **before** `--login`; see [Using a proxy](#using-a-proxy).

**Other:**

- `--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}` - Logging level (default: WARNING)

- Browser profile is stored at `~/.linkedin-mcp/profile/`

- *The browser cache keeps growing*: Patchright keeps an old Chromium revision for as long as any installed version still references it, and a `uv` archive or a second worktree is such a reference. The server logs a warning naming what it holds. To reclaim the space, stop every LinkedIn MCP Server instance, delete `~/.linkedin-mcp/patchright-browsers/`, and let the next launch download the current browser.
- Use `--logout` to clear the profile and start fresh

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **FAQ**
>
> **Is this safe to use? Will I get banned?**
> This tool controls a real browser session; it doesn't exploit undocumented APIs or bypass authentication. LinkedIn's User Agreement prohibits automated access, and accounts using automated tools can be restricted or banned. Use at your own risk; there is no guarantee of account safety. If you encounter any issues, let me know in the [Discussions](https://github.com/stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server/discussions).
>
> **What if my agents execute too many actions?**
